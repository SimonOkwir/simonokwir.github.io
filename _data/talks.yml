  abstract: \
      """State-of-the-art machine learning models can be vulnerable to very small input perturbations that are
    adversarially constructed. Adversarial attacks are a popular framework for studying these vulnerabilities.
    They consider worst-case input disturbances designed to maximize model error and got a lot of attention due
    to their impact on the performance of state-of-the-art models. Adversarial training considers extending model
    training with these examples and is an effective approach to defend against such attacks. This talk will explore
    adversarial attacks and training in linear regression.  There is a strong reason for this focus, for linear
    regression, adversarial training can be formulated as a convex and quadratic problem. Moreover, many interesting
    phenomena that can be observed in nonlinear models are still present. The setup is used to study the role of high
    dimensionality in robustness. And to reveal the connection between adversarial training, parameter-shrinking methods
    and minimum-norm solutions."""

      phenomena that can still be observed in nonlinear models are still present. The setup is used to study how
      high-dimensionality can be either a source of additional robustness or brittleness.  And also to show, in
      the linear setting, similarities (and differences) between $\ell_\infty$-adversarial training and the lasso
      and between $\ell_2$-adversarial training and ridge regression."""
