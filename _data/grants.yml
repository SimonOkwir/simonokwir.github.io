  description:
    Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been widely used to diagnose various cardiovascular diseases for
    over a century. Recent work from us and others have leveraged large medical cohorts and the latest
    developments in artificial intelligence (AI) to construct models that can predict diverse cardiovascular
    outcomes from the ECG. It has been shown that the prediction of these AI-ECG models contains more
    information than trained cardiologists can see and that they can be predictive of diverse outcomes. For
    instance, a model that can predict the development of atrial fibrillation within 5 years from normal ECGs.
    High standards of validation are needed to establish risk markers that can guide clinical action. This
    project intends to present methodological and practical developments that can allow AI-ECG to be used
    effectively as risk markers in clinical practice. The project is organized in subprojects that intend to
    I) test the added value to traditional risk score; II) develop time-to-event models; III) provide clinical
    validation in randomized and in-clinics scenarios.
    The subprojects have a dual goal, on the one hand, we intend to develop new methods and theories for
    AI through clinical questions. On the other hand, we intend to help building and validate AI-ECG tools.
    By addressing both in the same project we want to generate synergy between basic machine learning
    and medical development. We also want to educate a PhD student in interdisciplinary

  description: \
    The objective of the project is to develop, validate and implement, using AI, algorithms for the recognition of
    clinically relevant electrocardiographic abnormalities and for predicting the prognosis, with accuracy, security
    and transparency, for operation in cloud computing architectures and systems embedded in electrocardiographs,
    computers or mobile devices.
