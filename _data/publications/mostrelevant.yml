  contribution: I contributed to all aspects of the work, including its conception, implementation and analysis.
    I also presented intermediary results in conferences.
  relevance: It was a pioneering work on the use of deep neural networks for the analysis of 12-lead ECGs.
    We made the implementation and the datasets available and thousands of researchers downloaded them.
    According to Google Scholar, it was cited more than 150 times in less than two years.

  contribution: I am co-first author together with Emilly and Gabriella (equal contribution).
    I contributed to the implementation of all machine learning algorithms, the conception of the work, and the writing.
    They contributed respectively with the statistical and the medical analysis.
  relevance: We use artificial intelligence to deal with a task predicting age from the ECG.
    We have shown that the ECG predicted age is a good predictor of risk and is related to mortality risk.
    The work points to the fact that even normal ECG contains additional information for
    risk assessment and machine learning might be a useful tool for extracting this information.

  contribution:  I contributed to the implementation, writing, mathematical development and analysis.
  relevance: We study the challenges of parameter estimations for nonlinear dynamical systems. We show how regions
    of the parameter space could easily become hard to navigate due to the system's instability or chaos.
    We propose as a solution to it a method called multiple shooting, which divides the problem into smaller
    and well-behaved subproblems.

  contribution:  I contributed with the implementation, writing, mathematical development and analysis.
  relevance: In this paper, which complements and extends the previous one, we discuss how regions
    of the parameter space could become hard to navigate due to the system's unstability or chaos.
    We discuss this problem in recurrent neural networks and the role of dynamic attractors in storing
    information in these models.
- tag: ribeiro_parallel_2018
  contribution: I contributed with the implementation, writing, mathematical development and analysis.
  relevance: It was the first journal publication of my Ph.D. It studied the computational challenges
    and asymptotic properties of estimators with recurrence in their architecture. It shows how recurrent
    structures can be better for certain types of noise contamination. It also presents an analysis of the
    computational cost of the approach.
