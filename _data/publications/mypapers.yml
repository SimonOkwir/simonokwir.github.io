    Recent developments within deep learning are relevant for nonlinear system
    identification problems. In this paper, we establish connections between the
    deep learning and the system identification communities. It has recently
    been shown that convolutional architectures are at least as capable as
    recurrent architectures when it comes to sequence modeling tasks. Inspired
    by these results we explore the explicit relationships between the recently
    proposed temporal convolutional network (TCN) and two classic system
    identification model structures; Volterra series and block-oriented models.
    We end the paper with an experimental study where we provide results on two
    real-world problems, the well-known Silverbox dataset and a newer dataset
    originating from ground vibration experiments on an F-16 fighter aircraft.

    This paper is directed towards the problem of learning nonlinear ARX models
    based on system input--output data. In particular, our interest is in
    learning a conditional distribution of the current output based on a finite
    window of past inputs and outputs. To achieve this, we consider the use of
    so-called energy-based models, which have been developed in allied fields
    for learning unknown distributions based on data. This energy-based model
    relies on a general function to describe the distribution, and here we
    consider a deep neural network for this purpose. The primary benefit of this
    approach is that it is capable of learning both simple and highly complex
    noise models, which we demonstrate on simulated and experimental data.

    The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most commonly used exam for the screening
    and evaluation of cardiovascular diseases. Here we propose that the age
    predicted by artificial intelligence (AI) from the raw ECG tracing (ECG-age)
    can be a measure of cardiovascular health and provide prognostic
    information. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to predict a
    patient9s age from the 12-lead ECG using data from patients that underwent
    an ECG from 2010 to 2017 - the CODE study cohort (n=1,558,415 patients). On
    the 15% hold-out CODE test split, patients with ECG-age more than 8 years
    greater than chronological age had a higher mortality rate (hazard ratio
    (HR) 1.79, p&lt;0.001) in a mean follow-up of 3.67 years, whereas those with
    ECG-age more than 8 years less than chronological age had a lower mortality
    rate (HR 0.78, p&lt;0.001). Similar results were obtained in the external
    cohorts ELSA-Brasil (n=14,236) and SaMi-Trop (n=1,631). The ability to
    predict mortality from the ECG predicted age remains even when we adjust the
    model for cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, even for apparent normal
    ECGs, having a predicted ECG-age 8 or more years greater than chronological
    age remained a statistically significant predictor of risk (HR 1.53,
    p&lt;0.001 in CODE 15% test split). These results show that AI-enabled
    analysis of the ECG can add prognostic information to the interpretation of
    the 12-lead ECGs.

  abstract: >-
    In this work, we present a method to explain “end-toend” electrocardiogram
    (ECG) signal classiﬁers, where the explanations were built along with
    seniors cardiologist to provide meaningful features to the ﬁnal users. Our
    method focuses exclusively on automated ECG diagnosis and analyzes the
    explanation in terms of clinical accuracy for interpretability and
    robustness. The proposed method uses a noise-insertion strategy to quantify
    the impact of intervals and segments of the ECG signals on the automated
    classiﬁcation outcome. An ECG segmentation method was applied to ECG
    tracings, to obtain: (1) Intervals, Segments and Axis; (2) Rate, and (3)
    Rhythm. Noise was added to the signal to disturb the ECG features in a
    realistic way. The method was tested using Monte Carlo simulation and the
    feature impact is estimated by the change in the model prediction averaged
    over 499 executions and a feature is deﬁned as important if its mean value
    changes the result of the classiﬁer. We demonstrate our method by explaining
    diagnoses generated by a deep convolutional neural network. The proposed
    method is particularly effective and useful for modern deep learning models
    that take raw data as input.

    Introduction: Telehealth system is an important tool to improve access and
    quality to health assistance.Large electrocardiogram (ECG) databases, linked
    to mortality or hospitalization data, can be useful in determining the
    prognostic value of ECG markers. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a public health
    problem with increasing prevalence as the population ages, associated with
    cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.Hypothesis: Evaluate the association
    between the presence of AF with overall and cardiovascular mortality in a
    large electronic cohort of primary care patients of Minas Gerais.Methods:
    This is an observational retrospective study. Patients over 16 years old who
    performed digital electrocardiograms by Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais
    from 2013 to 2016 were assessed. A probabilistic linkage between data from
    the national mortality information system and our ECG database was made.
    Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted by a team of
    trained cardiologists and automatic software (Glasgow and Minnesota).The
    diagnosis of AF was considered if there was concordance between the
    cardiologist′s report and one of the automatic systems. In cases of
    disagreement, ECGs were reviewed manually.Only the first ECG made was
    analysed. To assess the relation between AF and mortality, Cox regression
    was used, adjusted by age, sex and clinical conditions.Results: From a
    dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,075,531 were included. The mean age was
    51.4 years, 40.5% male.The prevalence of AF was 1.15%. There were 2.9%
    deaths for all causes in 2.69 years of mean follow up. In univariate
    analysis, AF was a risk factor for death from all causes (HR 6.98, 95%CI
    6.68-7.28). After adjustment for age, sex and comorbidities, AF remained an
    independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR 2.49; 95% CI 2.39 -
    2.61). AF was also a predictor of risk for cardiovascular mortality after
    adjustment for age, sex and clinical conditions (HR 2.35, 95% CI 2.01-2.73).
    In multivariate analysis by sex, adjusted for age and comorbidities, AF
    women had higher risk of death for all causes (HR 3.06; 95% CI 2.86-3.26)
    than men (HR 2.18; 95% CI 2.06-2.32). There were no difference between sex
    in cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.34; 95% CI 2.01-2.73 for male sex e HR
    2.49; 95% CI 2.14-2.90 for female).Conclusions: AF was a strong predictor of
    mortality for all causes and cardiovascular mortality in primary care
    population with increased risk in women for deaths for all cause.

  abstract: >-
    Methods: This observational retrospective study of primary care patients was
    developed with the digital ECG database from the Telehealth Network of Minas
    Gerais, Brazil. ECGs performed from 2010 to 2017 were interpreted by
    cardiologists and the University of Glasgow automated analysis software. An
    electronic cohort was obtained linking data from ECG exams and those from a
    national mortality information system, using standard probabilistic linkage
    methods. We considered only the first ECG of each patient. Patients under 16
    years were excluded. Hazard ratios (HR) for mortality were adjusted for
    demographic and self-reported clinical factors and estimated with Cox
    regression.

    Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,558,421 were included, mean
    age 51.6 years; 40.2% male. There were 3.34% deaths from all causes in 3.68
    years of median follow up. The prevalence of AF was 1.33%. AF was an
    independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR 2.10, 95%CI 2.03–2.17)
    and cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.06, 95%CI 1.86–2.29). Females with AF had
    a higher risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality compared with males (p
    < 0.001).

    Conclusions: AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause
    mortality in a primary care population, with increased risk in women.

    Introduction: Aging affects the electrocardiogram (ECG) with a higher
    incidence of abnormalities in older patients. ECG-age can be predicted by
    artificial intelligence (AI) and can be used as a measure of cardiovascular
    health.Hypothesis: ECG-age predicted by AI is a risk factor for overall
    mortality.Methods: The Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiography
    (CODE) study is a retrospective cohort with a mean follow-up of 3.67
    years.The dataset consists of Brazilian patients, mainly from primary care
    centers. Two established cohorts, ELSA-Brasil, of Brazilian public servants,
    and SaMi-Trop, of Chagas disease patients, were used for external
    validation. 2,322,513 ECGs from 1,558,421 patients over 16 years old that
    underwent an ECG from 2010 to 2017 were included. A deep convolutional
    neural network was trained in order to predict the age of the patient based
    solely on ECG 12-lead tracings. The ECG database was split into 85-15%
    training and test datasets, respectively. Death was ascertained using
    probabilistic linkage with Brazil′s mortality information data. The Cox
    regression model, adjusted by age and sex, was used for statistical
    analysis. The model was validated in two cohorts: ELSA-Brasil (n=14,263) and
    SaMi-Trop (n=1,631).Results: he mean predicted ECG-age was 52.0 years
    (±18.7) with a mean absolute error of 8.38 (±7.0) years. Patients with
    ECG-age >8y older than chronological age had higher mortality rate (HR 1.79,
    95%CI 1.69-1.90; p<0.001), whereas those ECG-age >8y younger than
    chronological age were associated with a lower mortality rate (HR 0.78,
    95%CI 0.74-0.83; p<0.001). These results were similar in ELSA-Brasil and
    SaMi-Trop external validation cohorts (HR 1.75, 95%CI 1.35-2.27; p<0.001;HR
    2.42, 95%CI 1.53-3.83; p<0.001 for >8y difference, retrospectively; HR 0.74,
    95%CI 0.63-0.88; p<0.001;HR 0.89, 95%CI 0.52-1.54; p=0.68 for <8y
    difference, respectively).Conclusions: ECG-age, predicted by AI, can be
    useful as a tool for risk stratification of mortality.

    We present a model for predicting electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities in
    short-duration 12-lead ECG signals which outperformed medical doctors on the
    4th year of their cardiology residency. Such exams can provide a full
    evaluation of heart activity and have not been studied in previous
    end-to-end machine learning papers. Using the database of a large telehealth
    network, we built a novel dataset with more than 2 million ECG tracings,
    orders of magnitude larger than those used in previous studies. Moreover,
    our dataset is more realistic, as it consist of 12-lead ECGs recorded during
    standard in-clinics exams. Using this data, we trained a residual neural
    network with 9 convolutional layers to map 7 to 10 second ECG signals to 6
    classes of ECG abnormalities. Future work should extend these results to
    cover a large range of ECG abnormalities, which could improve the
    accessibility of this diagnostic tool and avoid wrong diagnosis from medical
    doctors.

  title: Automatic diagnosis of the 12-lead ECG using a deep neural network
  type: article-journal
  volume: '11'

  abstract: >-
    The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a major diagnostic test for
    cardiovascular diseases and enhanced automated analysis tools might lead to
    more reliable diagnosis and improved clinical practice. Deep neural networks
    are models composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples.
    Inspired by the success of these models in computer vision, we propose an
    end-to-end approach for the task at hand. We trained deep convolutional
    neural network models in the heterogeneous dataset provided in the Physionet
    2020 Challenge and used an ensemble of seven of these convolutional models
    for the classiﬁcation of abnormalities present in the ECG records. Ensembles
    use the output of multiple models to generate a combined prediction and are
    known to improve performance and generalization when compared to the
    individual models. In our submission, we use an ensemble of neural networks
    with the architecture similar to the one described in Nat Commun 11, 1760
    (2020) for 12-lead ECGs classiﬁcation. On the partially hidden test dataset
    from the challenge, the best-scored entry for our team (the “Code Team”) had
    a performance of 0.657, which place us in the 7-th place team-wise in the
    challenge leaderboard.

    System identification aims to build models of dynamical systems from data.
    Traditionally, choosing the model requires the designer to balance between
    two goals of conflicting nature; the model must be rich enough to capture
    the system dynamics, but not so flexible that it learns spurious random
    effects from the dataset. It is typically observed that model validation
    performance follows a U-shaped curve as the model complexity increases.
    Recent developments in machine learning and statistics, however, have
    observed situations where a "double-descent" curve subsumes this U-shaped
    model-performance curve. With a second decrease in performance occurring
    beyond the point where the model has reached the capacity of interpolating -
    i.e., (near) perfectly fitting - the training data. To the best of our
    knowledge, however, such phenomena have not been studied within the context
    of the identification of dynamic systems. The present paper aims to answer
    the question: "Can such a phenomenon also be observed when estimating
    parameters of dynamic systems?" We show the answer is yes, verifying such
    behavior experimentally both for artificially generated and real-world
    datasets.

    A stereo camera is a camera that simultaneously captures two or more images 

    in order to estimate depth. A stereo camera prototype was implemented using
    two image sensors. Its project was based on v200, a commercial camera
    produced by Invent Vision (iVision), company for which this prototype was
    developed. The major steps needed to estimate depth using a stereo camera
    were followed. They are: calibration (estimation of camera geometry and
    parameters), retification (aligning images), correspondence (finding
    correspondent points on the two images and the distance between them)

    and reconstruction (estimation of features depth using triangulation). All
    algorithms needed were implemented using C++ and integrated to the
    prototype. The prototype is able to estimate depth in a range of 0.7 to 20
    meters, it has a resolution on the order of a few centimeters and can reach
    a frame rate of 5 frames per second. The industrial camera v200 has all its
    internal processing computed by a FPGA. It is suggested, as a future work,
    to use the FPGA to speed up the retification and correspondence algorithms.
    The aim of this work was to take a first step towards a stereo camera based
    on v200 to be a competitive commercial product, apt to be sold by

    iVision.

    Learning nonlinear differentiable models for signals and systems:  with
    applications
  type: thesis

- id: ribeiro_parallel_2018
  abstract: "Neural network models for dynamic systems can be trained either in parallel or in series-parallel configurations. Influenced by early arguments, several papers justify the choice of series-parallel rather than parallel configuration claiming it has a lower computational cost, better stability properties during training and provides more accurate results. Other published results, on the other hand, defend parallel training as being more robust and capable of yielding more accurate long-term predictions. The main contribution of this paper is to present a study comparing both methods under the same unified framework with special attention to three aspects: (i)\_robustness of the estimation in the presence of noise; (ii)\_computational cost; and, (iii)\_convergence. A unifying mathematical framework and simulation studies show situations where each training method provides superior validation results and suggest that parallel training is generally better in more realistic scenarios. An example using measured data seems to reinforce such a claim. Complexity analysis and numerical examples show that both methods have similar computational cost although series-parallel training is more amenable to parallelization. Some informal discussion about stability and convergence properties is presented and explored in the examples."

    This paper studies parameter estimation of output error (OE) models. The
    commonly used approach of minimizing the free-run simulation error is called
    single shooting in contrast with the new multiple shooting approach proposed
    in this paper, for which the free-run simulation error of sub-datasets is
    minimized subject to equality constraints. The names “single shooting” and
    “multiple shooting” are used due to the similarities with techniques for
    estimating ODE (ordinary differential equation) parameters. Examples with
    nonlinear polynomial models illustrate the advantages of OE models as well
    as the capability of the multiple shooting approach to avoid undesirable
    local minima.

  title: Shooting Methods for Parameter Estimation of Output Error Models

  abstract: >-
    We shed new light on the smoothness of optimization problems arising in
    prediction error parameter estimation of linear and nonlinear systems. We
    show that for regions of the parameter space where the model is not
    contractive, the Lipschitz constant and beta-smoothness of the objective
    function might blow up exponentially with the simulation length, making it
    hard to numerically find minima within those regions or, even, to escape
    from them. In addition to providing theoretical understanding of this
    problem, this paper also proposes the use of multiple shooting as a viable
    solution. The proposed method minimizes the error between a prediction model
    and the observed values. Rather than running the prediction model over the
    entire dataset, multiple shooting splits the data into smaller subsets and
    runs the prediction model over each subset, making the simulation length a
    design parameter and making it possible to solve problems that would be
    infeasible using a standard approach. The equivalence to the original
    problem is obtained by including constraints in the optimization. The new
    method is illustrated by estimating the parameters of nonlinear systems with
    chaotic or unstable behavior, as well as neural networks. We also present a
    comparative analysis of the proposed method with multi-step-ahead prediction
    error minimization.

    Digital electrocardiographs are now widely available and a large number of
    digital electrocardiograms (ECGs) have been recorded and stored. The present
    study describes the development and clinical applications of a large
    database of such digital ECGs, namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital
    Electrocardiology) study. ECGs obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas
    Gerais, Brazil, from 2010 to 17, were organized in a structured database. A
    hierarchical free-text machine learning algorithm recognized specific ECG
    diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow ECG Analysis Program
    provided Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic statements. The presence
    of a specific ECG abnormality was considered when both automatic and medical
    diagnosis were concordant; cases of discordance were decided using
    heuristisc rules and manual review. The ECG database was linked to the
    national mortality information system using probabilistic linkage methods.
    From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. After excluding the
    ECGs with technical problems and patients <16 years-old, 1,558,415 patients
    were studied. High performance measures were obtained using an end-to-end
    deep neural network trained to detect 6 types of ECG abnormalities, with F1
    scores >80% and specificity >99% in an independent test dataset. We also
    evaluated the risk of mortality associated with the presence of atrial
    fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was a strong predictor of
    cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all causes, with increased risk
    in women. In conclusion, a large database that comprises all ECGs performed
    by a large telehealth network can be useful for further developments in the
    field of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and cardiovascular
    epidemiology.

    SciPy is an open source scientific computing library for the Python
    programming language. SciPy 1.0 was released in late 2017, about 16 years
    after the original version 0.1 release. SciPy has become a de facto standard
    for leveraging scientific algorithms in the Python programming language,
    with more than 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent
    packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories, and millions of downloads per
    year. This includes usage of SciPy in almost half of all machine learning
    projects on GitHub, and usage by high profile projects including LIGO
    gravitational wave analysis and creation of the first-ever image of a black
    hole (M87). The library includes functionality spanning clustering, Fourier
    transforms, integration, interpolation, file I/O, linear algebra, image
    processing, orthogonal distance regression, minimization algorithms, signal
    processing, sparse matrix handling, computational geometry, and statistics.
    In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development
    practices of the SciPy library and highlight some recent technical
    developments.
