    Recent developments within deep learning are relevant for nonlinear system
    identification problems. In this paper, we establish connections between the
    deep learning and the system identification communities. It has recently
    been shown that convolutional architectures are at least as capable as
    recurrent architectures when it comes to sequence modeling tasks. Inspired
    by these results we explore the explicit relationships between the recently
    proposed temporal convolutional network (TCN) and two classic system
    identification model structures; Volterra series and block-oriented models.
    We end the paper with an experimental study where we provide results on two
    real-world problems, the well-known Silverbox dataset and a newer dataset
    originating from ground vibration experiments on an F-16 fighter aircraft.

    This study aims to assess whether information derived from the raw 12-lead
    electrocardiogram (ECG) combined with clinical information is predictive of
    atrial fibrillation (AF) development.We use a subset of the Telehealth
    Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG) database consisting of patients that had
    repeated 12-lead ECG measurements between 2010-2017 that is 1,130,404
    recordings from 415,389 unique patients. Median and interquartile of age for
    the recordings were 58 (46-69) and 38% of the patients were males.
    Recordings were assigned to train-validation and test sets in an 80:20%
    split which was stratified by class, age and gender. A random forest
    classifier was trained to predict, for a given recording, the risk of AF
    development within 5-years. We use features obtained from different
    modalities, namely demographics, clinical information, engineered features,
    and features from deep representation learning.The best model performance on
    the test set was obtained for the model combining features from all
    modalities with an AUROC=0.909 against the best single modality model which
    had an AUROC=0.839.Our study has important clinical implications for AF
    management. It is the first study integrating feature engineering, deep
    learning and EMR metadata to create a risk prediction tool for the
    management of patients at risk of AF. The best model that includes features
    from all modalities demonstrates that human knowledge in electrophysiology
    combined with deep learning outperforms any single modality approach. The
    high performance obtained suggest that structural changes in the 12-lead ECG
    are associated with existing or impending AF.

    Self-supervised learning is a paradigm that extracts general features which
    describe the input space by artificially generating labels from the input
    without the need for explicit annotations. The learned features can then be
    used by transfer learning to boost the performance on a downstream task.
    Such methods have recently produced state of the art results in natural
    language processing and computer vision. Here, we propose a self-supervised
    learning method for 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). For pretraining the
    model we design a task to mask out subsegements of all channels of the input
    signals and try to predict the actual values. As the model architecture, we
    use a U-ResNet containing an encoder-decoder structure. We test our method
    by self-supervised pretraining on the CODE dataset and then transfer the
    learnt features by finetuning on the PTB-XL and CPSC benchmarks to evaluate
    the effect of our method in the classification of 12-leads ECGs. The method
    does provide modest improvements in performance when compared to not using
    pretraining. In future work we will make use of these ideas in smaller
    dataset, where we believe it can lead to larger performance gains.

    ResNet-based ECG Diagnosis of Myocardial Infarction in the Emergency
    Department
  type: paper-conference

  abstract: >-
    Myocardial infarction diagnosis is a common challenge in the emergency
    department. In managed settings, deep learning-based models and especially
    convolutional deep models have shown promise in electrocardiogram (ECG)
    classification, but there is a lack of high-performing models for the
    diagnosis of myocardial infarction in real-world scenarios. We aimed to
    train and validate a deep learning model using ECGs to predict myocardial
    infarction in real-world emergency department patients. We studied emergency
    department patients in the Stockholm region between 2007 and 2016 that had
    an ECG obtained because of their presenting complaint. We developed a deep
    neural network based on convolutional layers similar to a residual network.
    Inputs to the model were ECG tracing, age, and sex; and outputs were the
    probabilities of three mutually exclusive classes: non-ST-elevation
    myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI),
    and control status, as registered in the SWEDEHEART and other registries. We
    used an ensemble of five models. Among 492,226 ECGs in 214,250 patients,
    5,416 were recorded with an NSTEMI, 1,818 a STEMI, and 485,207 without a
    myocardial infarction. In a random test set, our model could discriminate
    STEMIs/NSTEMIs from controls with a C-statistic of 0.991/0.832 and had a
    Brier score of 0.001/0.008. The model obtained a similar performance in a
    temporally separated test set of the study sample, and achieved a
    C-statistic of 0.985 and a Brier score of 0.002 in discriminating STEMIs
    from controls in an external test set. We developed and validated a deep
    learning model with excellent performance in discriminating between control,
    STEMI, and NSTEMI on the presenting ECG of a real-world sample of the
    important population of all-comers to the emergency department. Hence, deep
    learning models for ECG decision support could be valuable in the emergency
    department.

    This paper is directed towards the problem of learning nonlinear ARX models
    based on system input--output data. In particular, our interest is in
    learning a conditional distribution of the current output based on a finite
    window of past inputs and outputs. To achieve this, we consider the use of
    so-called energy-based models, which have been developed in allied fields
    for learning unknown distributions based on data. This energy-based model
    relies on a general function to describe the distribution, and here we
    consider a deep neural network for this purpose. The primary benefit of this
    approach is that it is capable of learning both simple and highly complex
    noise models, which we demonstrate on simulated and experimental data.

    Screening for Chagas disease from the electrocardiogram using a deep neural
    network
  type: article-journal

- id: lima_deep_2021
  abstract: >-
    The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most commonly used exam for the screening
    and evaluation of cardiovascular diseases. Here we propose that the age
    predicted by artificial intelligence (AI) from the raw ECG tracing (ECG-age)
    can be a measure of cardiovascular health and provide prognostic
    information. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to predict a
    patient9s age from the 12-lead ECG using data from patients that underwent
    an ECG from 2010 to 2017 - the CODE study cohort (n=1,558,415 patients). On
    the 15% hold-out CODE test split, patients with ECG-age more than 8 years
    greater than chronological age had a higher mortality rate (hazard ratio
    (HR) 1.79, p&lt;0.001) in a mean follow-up of 3.67 years, whereas those with
    ECG-age more than 8 years less than chronological age had a lower mortality
    rate (HR 0.78, p&lt;0.001). Similar results were obtained in the external
    cohorts ELSA-Brasil (n=14,236) and SaMi-Trop (n=1,631). The ability to
    predict mortality from the ECG predicted age remains even when we adjust the
    model for cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, even for apparent normal
    ECGs, having a predicted ECG-age 8 or more years greater than chronological
    age remained a statistically significant predictor of risk (HR 1.53,
    p&lt;0.001 in CODE 15% test split). These results show that AI-enabled
    analysis of the ECG can add prognostic information to the interpretation of
    the 12-lead ECGs.

  abstract: >-
    Despite the potentials of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, very
    little work focuses on the extraction of clinical information or knowledge
    discovery from clinical measurements. Here we propose a novel deep learning
    model to extract characteristics in electrocardiogram (ECG) and explore its
    usage in knowledge discovery. Utilising a 12-lead ECG dataset (nECGs =
    2,322,513) collected from unique subjects (nSubjects = 1,558,772) in primary
    care, we performed three independent medical tasks with the proposed model:
    (i) cardiac abnormality diagnosis, (ii) gender identification, and (iii)
    hypertension screening. We achieved an area under the curve (AUC) score of
    0.998 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.995-0.999), 0.964 (95% CI,
    0.963-0.965), and 0.839 (95% CI, 0.837-0.841) for each task, respectively;
    We provide interpretation of salient morphologies and further identified key
    ECG leads that achieve similar performance for the three tasks: (i) AVR and
    V1 leads (AUC=0.990 (95% CI, 0.982-0.995); (ii) V5 lead (AUC=0.900 (95% CI,
    0.899-0.902)); and (iii) V1 lead (AUC=0.816 (95% CI, 0.814-0.818)). Using
    ECGs, our model not only has demonstrated cardiologist-level accuracy in
    heart diagnosis with interpretability, but also shows its potentials in
    facilitating clinical knowledge discovery for gender and hypertension
    detection which are not readily available.

  title: Contextualized Interpretable Machine Learning for Medical Diagnosis
  type: article-journal

  abstract: >-
    In this work, we present a method to explain “end-toend” electrocardiogram
    (ECG) signal classiﬁers, where the explanations were built along with
    seniors cardiologist to provide meaningful features to the ﬁnal users. Our
    method focuses exclusively on automated ECG diagnosis and analyzes the
    explanation in terms of clinical accuracy for interpretability and
    robustness. The proposed method uses a noise-insertion strategy to quantify
    the impact of intervals and segments of the ECG signals on the automated
    classiﬁcation outcome. An ECG segmentation method was applied to ECG
    tracings, to obtain: (1) Intervals, Segments and Axis; (2) Rate, and (3)
    Rhythm. Noise was added to the signal to disturb the ECG features in a
    realistic way. The method was tested using Monte Carlo simulation and the
    feature impact is estimated by the change in the model prediction averaged
    over 499 executions and a feature is deﬁned as important if its mean value
    changes the result of the classiﬁer. We demonstrate our method by explaining
    diagnoses generated by a deep convolutional neural network. The proposed
    method is particularly effective and useful for modern deep learning models
    that take raw data as input.

    Introduction: Telehealth system is an important tool to improve access and
    quality to health assistance.Large electrocardiogram (ECG) databases, linked
    to mortality or hospitalization data, can be useful in determining the
    prognostic value of ECG markers. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a public health
    problem with increasing prevalence as the population ages, associated with
    cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.Hypothesis: Evaluate the association
    between the presence of AF with overall and cardiovascular mortality in a
    large electronic cohort of primary care patients of Minas Gerais.Methods:
    This is an observational retrospective study. Patients over 16 years old who
    performed digital electrocardiograms by Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais
    from 2013 to 2016 were assessed. A probabilistic linkage between data from
    the national mortality information system and our ECG database was made.
    Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted by a team of
    trained cardiologists and automatic software (Glasgow and Minnesota).The
    diagnosis of AF was considered if there was concordance between the
    cardiologist′s report and one of the automatic systems. In cases of
    disagreement, ECGs were reviewed manually.Only the first ECG made was
    analysed. To assess the relation between AF and mortality, Cox regression
    was used, adjusted by age, sex and clinical conditions.Results: From a
    dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,075,531 were included. The mean age was
    51.4 years, 40.5% male.The prevalence of AF was 1.15%. There were 2.9%
    deaths for all causes in 2.69 years of mean follow up. In univariate
    analysis, AF was a risk factor for death from all causes (HR 6.98, 95%CI
    6.68-7.28). After adjustment for age, sex and comorbidities, AF remained an
    independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR 2.49; 95% CI 2.39 -
    2.61). AF was also a predictor of risk for cardiovascular mortality after
    adjustment for age, sex and clinical conditions (HR 2.35, 95% CI 2.01-2.73).
    In multivariate analysis by sex, adjusted for age and comorbidities, AF
    women had higher risk of death for all causes (HR 3.06; 95% CI 2.86-3.26)
    than men (HR 2.18; 95% CI 2.06-2.32). There were no difference between sex
    in cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.34; 95% CI 2.01-2.73 for male sex e HR
    2.49; 95% CI 2.14-2.90 for female).Conclusions: AF was a strong predictor of
    mortality for all causes and cardiovascular mortality in primary care
    population with increased risk in women for deaths for all cause.

  abstract: >-
    Computerized electrocardiography (ECG) has been widely used and allows
    linkage to electronic medical records. The present study describes the
    development and clinical applications of an electronic cohort derived from a
    digital ECG database obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais,
    Brazil, for the period 2010–2017, linked to the mortality data from the
    national information system, the Clinical Outcomes in Digital
    Electrocardiography (CODE) dataset. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients
    were identified. A total of 1,666,778 (94%) underwent a valid ECG recording
    for the period 2010 to 2017, with 1,558,421 patients over 16 years old;
    40.2% were men, with a mean age of 51.7 [SD 17.6] years. During a mean
    follow-up of 3.7 years, the mortality rate was 3.3%. ECG abnormalities
    assessed were: atrial fibrillation (AF), right bundle branch block (RBBB),
    left bundle branch block (LBBB), atrioventricular block (AVB), and
    ventricular pre-excitation. Most ECG abnormalities (AF: Hazard ratio [HR]
    2.10; 95% CI 2.03–2.17; RBBB: HR 1.32; 95%CI 1.27–1.36; LBBB: HR 1.69; 95%
    CI 1.62–1.76; first degree AVB: Relative survival [RS]: 0.76; 95%
    CI0.71–0.81; 2:1 AVB: RS 0.21 95% CI0.09–0.52; and RS 0.36; third degree
    AVB: 95% CI 0.26–0.49) were predictors of overall mortality, except for
    ventricular pre-excitation (HR 1.41; 95% CI 0.56–3.57) and Mobitz I AVB (RS
    0.65; 95% CI 0.34–1.24). In conclusion, a large ECG database established by
    a telehealth network can be a useful tool for facilitating new advances in
    the fields of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and
    cardiovascular epidemiology.

    Evaluation of mortality in bundle branch block patients from an electronic
    cohort: Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiography (CODE) study
  type: article-journal

- id: paixao_evaluation_2020
  abstract: >-
    Methods: This observational retrospective study of primary care patients was
    developed with the digital ECG database from the Telehealth Network of Minas
    Gerais, Brazil. ECGs performed from 2010 to 2017 were interpreted by
    cardiologists and the University of Glasgow automated analysis software. An
    electronic cohort was obtained linking data from ECG exams and those from a
    national mortality information system, using standard probabilistic linkage
    methods. We considered only the first ECG of each patient. Patients under 16
    years were excluded. Hazard ratios (HR) for mortality were adjusted for
    demographic and self-reported clinical factors and estimated with Cox
    regression.

    Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,558,421 were included, mean
    age 51.6 years; 40.2% male. There were 3.34% deaths from all causes in 3.68
    years of median follow up. The prevalence of AF was 1.33%. AF was an
    independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR 2.10, 95%CI 2.03–2.17)
    and cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.06, 95%CI 1.86–2.29). Females with AF had
    a higher risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality compared with males (p
    < 0.001).

    Conclusions: AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause
    mortality in a primary care population, with increased risk in women.

    Introduction: Aging affects the electrocardiogram (ECG) with a higher
    incidence of abnormalities in older patients. ECG-age can be predicted by
    artificial intelligence (AI) and can be used as a measure of cardiovascular
    health.Hypothesis: ECG-age predicted by AI is a risk factor for overall
    mortality.Methods: The Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiography
    (CODE) study is a retrospective cohort with a mean follow-up of 3.67
    years.The dataset consists of Brazilian patients, mainly from primary care
    centers. Two established cohorts, ELSA-Brasil, of Brazilian public servants,
    and SaMi-Trop, of Chagas disease patients, were used for external
    validation. 2,322,513 ECGs from 1,558,421 patients over 16 years old that
    underwent an ECG from 2010 to 2017 were included. A deep convolutional
    neural network was trained in order to predict the age of the patient based
    solely on ECG 12-lead tracings. The ECG database was split into 85-15%
    training and test datasets, respectively. Death was ascertained using
    probabilistic linkage with Brazil′s mortality information data. The Cox
    regression model, adjusted by age and sex, was used for statistical
    analysis. The model was validated in two cohorts: ELSA-Brasil (n=14,263) and
    SaMi-Trop (n=1,631).Results: he mean predicted ECG-age was 52.0 years
    (±18.7) with a mean absolute error of 8.38 (±7.0) years. Patients with
    ECG-age >8y older than chronological age had higher mortality rate (HR 1.79,
    95%CI 1.69-1.90; p<0.001), whereas those ECG-age >8y younger than
    chronological age were associated with a lower mortality rate (HR 0.78,
    95%CI 0.74-0.83; p<0.001). These results were similar in ELSA-Brasil and
    SaMi-Trop external validation cohorts (HR 1.75, 95%CI 1.35-2.27; p<0.001;HR
    2.42, 95%CI 1.53-3.83; p<0.001 for >8y difference, retrospectively; HR 0.74,
    95%CI 0.63-0.88; p<0.001;HR 0.89, 95%CI 0.52-1.54; p=0.68 for <8y
    difference, respectively).Conclusions: ECG-age, predicted by AI, can be
    useful as a tool for risk stratification of mortality.

    We present a model for predicting electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities in
    short-duration 12-lead ECG signals which outperformed medical doctors on the
    4th year of their cardiology residency. Such exams can provide a full
    evaluation of heart activity and have not been studied in previous
    end-to-end machine learning papers. Using the database of a large telehealth
    network, we built a novel dataset with more than 2 million ECG tracings,
    orders of magnitude larger than those used in previous studies. Moreover,
    our dataset is more realistic, as it consist of 12-lead ECGs recorded during
    standard in-clinics exams. Using this data, we trained a residual neural
    network with 9 convolutional layers to map 7 to 10 second ECG signals to 6
    classes of ECG abnormalities. Future work should extend these results to
    cover a large range of ECG abnormalities, which could improve the
    accessibility of this diagnostic tool and avoid wrong diagnosis from medical
    doctors.

    Automatic Diagnosis of Short-Duration 12-Lead ECG using a Deep Convolutional
    Network

  abstract: >-
    The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a major diagnostic test for
    cardiovascular diseases and enhanced automated analysis tools might lead to
    more reliable diagnosis and improved clinical practice. Deep neural networks
    are models composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples.
    Inspired by the success of these models in computer vision, we propose an
    end-to-end approach for the task at hand. We trained deep convolutional
    neural network models in the heterogeneous dataset provided in the Physionet
    2020 Challenge and used an ensemble of seven of these convolutional models
    for the classiﬁcation of abnormalities present in the ECG records. Ensembles
    use the output of multiple models to generate a combined prediction and are
    known to improve performance and generalization when compared to the
    individual models. In our submission, we use an ensemble of neural networks
    with the architecture similar to the one described in Nat Commun 11, 1760
    (2020) for 12-lead ECGs classiﬁcation. On the partially hidden test dataset
    from the challenge, the best-scored entry for our team (the “Code Team”) had
    a performance of 0.657, which place us in the 7-th place team-wise in the
    challenge leaderboard.

    A stereo camera is a camera that simultaneously captures two or more images 

    in order to estimate depth. A stereo camera prototype was implemented using
    two image sensors. Its project was based on v200, a commercial camera
    produced by Invent Vision (iVision), company for which this prototype was
    developed. The major steps needed to estimate depth using a stereo camera
    were followed. They are: calibration (estimation of camera geometry and
    parameters), retification (aligning images), correspondence (finding
    correspondent points on the two images and the distance between them)

    and reconstruction (estimation of features depth using triangulation). All
    algorithms needed were implemented using C++ and integrated to the
    prototype. The prototype is able to estimate depth in a range of 0.7 to 20
    meters, it has a resolution on the order of a few centimeters and can reach
    a frame rate of 5 frames per second. The industrial camera v200 has all its
    internal processing computed by a FPGA. It is suggested, as a future work,
    to use the FPGA to speed up the retification and correspondence algorithms.
    The aim of this work was to take a first step towards a stereo camera based
    on v200 to be a competitive commercial product, apt to be sold by

    iVision.

    As machine learning models start to be used in critical applications, their
    vulnerabilities and brittleness become a pressing concern. Adversarial
    attacks are a popular framework for studying these vulnerabilities. In this
    work, we study the error of linear regression in the face of adversarial
    attacks. We provide bounds of the error in terms of the traditional risk and
    the parameter norm and show how these bounds can be leveraged and make it
    possible to use analysis from non-adversarial setups to study the
    adversarial risk. The usefulness of these results is illustrated by shedding
    light on whether or not overparameterized linear models can be adversarially
    robust. We show that adding features to linear models might be either a
    source of additional robustness or brittleness. We show that these
    differences appear due to scaling and how the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms of
    random projections concentrate. We also show how the reformulation we
    propose allows for solving adversarial training as a convex optimization
    problem. This is then used as a tool to study how adversarial training and
    other regularization methods might affect the robustness of the estimated
    models.

  type: paper-conference

- id: ribeiro_parallel_2018
  abstract: "Neural network models for dynamic systems can be trained either in parallel or in series-parallel configurations. Influenced by early arguments, several papers justify the choice of series-parallel rather than parallel configuration claiming it has a lower computational cost, better stability properties during training and provides more accurate results. Other published results, on the other hand, defend parallel training as being more robust and capable of yielding more accurate long-term predictions. The main contribution of this paper is to present a study comparing both methods under the same unified framework with special attention to three aspects: (i)\_robustness of the estimation in the presence of noise; (ii)\_computational cost; and, (iii)\_convergence. A unifying mathematical framework and simulation studies show situations where each training method provides superior validation results and suggest that parallel training is generally better in more realistic scenarios. An example using measured data seems to reinforce such a claim. Complexity analysis and numerical examples show that both methods have similar computational cost although series-parallel training is more amenable to parallelization. Some informal discussion about stability and convergence properties is presented and explored in the examples."

    This paper studies parameter estimation of output error (OE) models. The
    commonly used approach of minimizing the free-run simulation error is called
    single shooting in contrast with the new multiple shooting approach proposed
    in this paper, for which the free-run simulation error of sub-datasets is
    minimized subject to equality constraints. The names “single shooting” and
    “multiple shooting” are used due to the similarities with techniques for
    estimating ODE (ordinary differential equation) parameters. Examples with
    nonlinear polynomial models illustrate the advantages of OE models as well
    as the capability of the multiple shooting approach to avoid undesirable
    local minima.

  title: Shooting Methods for Parameter Estimation of Output Error Models
  type: article-journal
  volume: '50'

- id: ribeiro_smoothness_2020
  abstract: >-
    We shed new light on the smoothness of optimization problems arising in
    prediction error parameter estimation of linear and nonlinear systems. We
    show that for regions of the parameter space where the model is not
    contractive, the Lipschitz constant and beta-smoothness of the objective
    function might blow up exponentially with the simulation length, making it
    hard to numerically find minima within those regions or, even, to escape
    from them. In addition to providing theoretical understanding of this
    problem, this paper also proposes the use of multiple shooting as a viable
    solution. The proposed method minimizes the error between a prediction model
    and the observed values. Rather than running the prediction model over the
    entire dataset, multiple shooting splits the data into smaller subsets and
    runs the prediction model over each subset, making the simulation length a
    design parameter and making it possible to solve problems that would be
    infeasible using a standard approach. The equivalence to the original
    problem is obtained by including constraints in the optimization. The new
    method is illustrated by estimating the parameters of nonlinear systems with
    chaotic or unstable behavior, as well as neural networks. We also present a
    comparative analysis of the proposed method with multi-step-ahead prediction
    error minimization.

    State-of-the-art machine learning models can be vulnerable to very small
    input perturbations that are adversarially constructed. Adversarial training
    is one of the most effective approaches to defend against such examples. We
    show that for linear regression problems, adversarial training can be
    formulated as a convex problem. This fact is then used to show that
    $\ell_\infty$-adversarial training produces sparse solutions and has many
    similarities to the lasso method. Similarly, $\ell_2$-adversarial training
    has similarities with ridge regression. We use a robust regression framework
    to analyze and understand these similarities and also point to some
    differences. Finally, we show how adversarial training behaves differently
    from other regularization methods when estimating overparameterized models
    (i.e., models with more parameters than datapoints). It minimizes a sum of
    three terms which regularizes the solution, but unlike lasso and ridge
    regression, it can sharply transition into an interpolation mode. We show
    that for sufficiently many features or sufficiently small regularization
    parameters, the learned model perfectly interpolates the training data while
    still exhibiting good out-of-sample performance.

    Digital electrocardiographs are now widely available and a large number of
    digital electrocardiograms (ECGs) have been recorded and stored. The present
    study describes the development and clinical applications of a large
    database of such digital ECGs, namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital
    Electrocardiology) study. ECGs obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas
    Gerais, Brazil, from 2010 to 17, were organized in a structured database. A
    hierarchical free-text machine learning algorithm recognized specific ECG
    diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow ECG Analysis Program
    provided Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic statements. The presence
    of a specific ECG abnormality was considered when both automatic and medical
    diagnosis were concordant; cases of discordance were decided using
    heuristisc rules and manual review. The ECG database was linked to the
    national mortality information system using probabilistic linkage methods.
    From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. After excluding the
    ECGs with technical problems and patients <16 years-old, 1,558,415 patients
    were studied. High performance measures were obtained using an end-to-end
    deep neural network trained to detect 6 types of ECG abnormalities, with F1
    scores >80% and specificity >99% in an independent test dataset. We also
    evaluated the risk of mortality associated with the presence of atrial
    fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was a strong predictor of
    cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all causes, with increased risk
    in women. In conclusion, a large database that comprises all ECGs performed
    by a large telehealth network can be useful for further developments in the
    field of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and cardiovascular
    epidemiology.

    Left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is associated with over 8-fold
    increased risk of heart failure and 2-fold risk of premature death. To allow
    early detection by clinicians, we developed a layout-independent deep
    learning model that identifies LV systolic dysfunction directly from images
    of electrocardiograms (ECGs). Overall, 393,910 ECGs with paired
    echocardiograms were used for model development. The model performed well
    across multiple image formats (AUROC 0.91, AUPRC 0.69), and two external
    sets of real-world ECG images from an outpatient academic center (AUROC
    0.93, AUPRC 0.69) and a rural hospital system (AUROC 0.91, AUPRC 0.89).
    Class-discriminative patterns localized to the anterior and anteroseptal
    leads corresponding to the left ventricle, regardless of ECG layout. A
    positive ECG screen in individuals with preserved LV ejection fraction was
    associated with 4-fold increased risk of developing LV systolic dysfunction
    in future. This approach represents an automated and accessible screening
    strategy for LV systolic dysfunction.

    SciPy is an open source scientific computing library for the Python
    programming language. SciPy 1.0 was released in late 2017, about 16 years
    after the original version 0.1 release. SciPy has become a de facto standard
    for leveraging scientific algorithms in the Python programming language,
    with more than 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent
    packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories, and millions of downloads per
    year. This includes usage of SciPy in almost half of all machine learning
    projects on GitHub, and usage by high profile projects including LIGO
    gravitational wave analysis and creation of the first-ever image of a black
    hole (M87). The library includes functionality spanning clustering, Fourier
    transforms, integration, interpolation, file I/O, linear algebra, image
    processing, orthogonal distance regression, minimization algorithms, signal
    processing, sparse matrix handling, computational geometry, and statistics.
    In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development
    practices of the SciPy library and highlight some recent technical
    developments.

    Objective: Imbalances of the electrolyte concentration levels in the body
    can lead to catastrophic consequences, but accurate and accessible
    measurements could improve patient outcomes. While blood tests provide
    accurate measurements, they are invasive and the laboratory analysis can be
    slow or inaccessible. In contrast, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely
    adopted tool which is quick and simple to acquire. However, the problem of
    estimating continuous electrolyte concentrations directly from ECGs is not
    well-studied. We therefore investigate if regression methods can be used for
    accurate ECG-based prediction of electrolyte concentrations. Methods: We
    explore the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for this task. We analyze the
    regression performance across four electrolytes, utilizing a novel dataset
    containing over 290000 ECGs. For improved understanding, we also study the
    full spectrum from continuous predictions to binary classification of
    extreme concentration levels. To enhance clinical usefulness, we finally
    extend to a probabilistic regression approach and evaluate different
    uncertainty estimates. Results: We find that the performance varies
    significantly between different electrolytes, which is clinically justified
    in the interplay of electrolytes and their manifestation in the ECG. We also
    compare the regression accuracy with that of traditional machine learning
    models, demonstrating superior performance of DNNs. Conclusion:
    Discretization can lead to good classification performance, but does not
    help solve the original problem of predicting continuous concentration
    levels. While probabilistic regression demonstrates potential practical
    usefulness, the uncertainty estimates are not particularly well-calibrated.
    Significance: Our study is a first step towards accurate and reliable
    ECG-based prediction of electrolyte concentration levels.

    Objective: Over the past few years, deep learning (DL) has been used
    extensively in research for 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis.
    However, it is unclear whether the explicit or implicit claims made on DL
    superiority to the more classical feature engineering (FE) approaches, based
    on domain knowledge, hold. In addition, it remains unclear whether combining
    DL with FE may improve performance over a single modality. Methods: To
    address these research gaps and in-line with recent major experiments, we
    revisited three tasks: cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis (multiclass-multilabel
    classification), atrial fibrillation risk prediction (binary
    classification), and age estimation (regression). We used an overall dataset
    of 2.3M 12-lead ECG recordings to train the following models for each task:
    i) a random forest taking FE as input; ii) an end-to-end DL model; and iii)
    a merged model of FE+DL. Results: FE yielded comparable results to DL while
    necessitating significantly less data for the two classification tasks. DL
    outperformed FE for the regression task. For all tasks, merging FE with DL
    did not improve performance over DL alone. These findings were confirmed on
    the additional PTB-XL dataset. Conclusion: We found that for traditional
    12-lead ECG based diagnosis tasks, DL did not yield a meaningful improvement
    over FE, while it improved significantly the nontraditional regression task.
    We also found that combining FE with DL did not improve over DL alone, which
    suggests that the FE were redundant with the features learned by DL.
    Significance: Our findings provides important recommendations on 12-lead ECG
    based machine learning strategy and data regime to choose for a given task.
    When looking at maximizing performance as the end goal, if the task is
    nontraditional and a large dataset is available then DL is preferable. If
    the task is a classical one and/or a small dataset is available then a FE
    approach may be the better choice.
