  description: >-
    Modeling oil wells using historical data from sensors. In offshore oil extraction, the instruments located
    at the bottom of the well undergo a rapid wear due to extreme conditions. The maintenance and exchange of
    such equipment is complicated and expensive. In this context, obtain mathematical models for variables at
    the bottom of the oil well, from platform variables would be a simple and inexpensive solution. These
    mathematical models are also called virtual sensors. As a undergraduate student I participated on a research and
    development project coordinated by professor Luis Ant√¥nio Aguirre at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Brasil)
    together with Petrobras Oil Company together for the development of virtual sensors of the instrumented located at
    the bottom of the oil well.
