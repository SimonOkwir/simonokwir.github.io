  description: >-
    Building a stereo camera based on FPGA technology. A stereo camera is a camera
    that captures two (or more images) simultaneously from different viewpoints for the purpose of estimating depth.
    The idea mimics our own eyes, which give us a sense of depth precisely
    because they capture two simultaneous images from different points of view.
    I worked in all stages of its development, from the image aquisition using FPGA technology to the
    several steps required to estimate the depth of a scene using a stereo camera calibration (determination of geometry
    and parameters of the stereo camera), rectification (alignment of the images), correspondence (determination of the
    corresponding points in the two images and the distance between them) and reconstruction (calculating the
    position of objects by triangulation). The project was develop during my interniship at Invent Vision hardware
    development team. The company develops cameras and provides computer vision solutions for industry. At that point
    the company was commissioned to make a decoking monitoring system at an oil refinery. For this task, it was
    interesting to have a cloud of points  containing the internal structure of the refinery drum, which sparked the
    company's interest in stereo vision technology. Working there, I developed a prototype of a stereo camera which is
    described in a monograph I wrote during my undergraduate course as requirement for obtaing the Bachelor degree in
    Electrical Engineering.

  description: >-
    Modeling oil wells using historical data from sensors. In offshore oil extraction, the instruments located
    at the bottom of the well undergo a rapid wear due to extreme conditions. The maintenance and exchange of
    such equipment is complicated and expensive. In this context, obtain mathematical models for variables at
    the bottom of the oil well, from platform variables would be a simple and inexpensive solution. These
    mathematical models are also called virtual sensors. As a undergraduate student, I participated on a research and
    development project coordinated by professor Luis Ant√¥nio Aguirre at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Brasil)
    together with Petrobras Oil Company together for the development of virtual sensors for the measurement
    instrumented located at the bottom of the production column in offshore oil extraction.
