    The electrocardiogram is a medical test used to measure cardiac electrical activity, being the
    most common complementary exam to assess the heart condition. My current research leverages
    the latest developments in machine learning for extending and improving how ECG is used in clinical practice.
    My involvement with ECG analysis started in 2018 when I joined the research group CODE
    (Clinical Outcomes in Electrocardiography) at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. Using a
    dataset with more then 2 million entries collected and annotated between 2010 to 2017 by the Telehealth Network
    of Minas Gerais we developed a system capable of detecting some ECG abnormalities with greater accuracy
    then cardiology residents. After this successful proof of concept project, I am now involved on diverse projects
    using AI for ECG analysis including: the prediction of age from the ECG and its use for improving
    risk assessment; the creation of tools to detect Atrial Fibrillation before its development; and, tools for
    detecting non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Now, working not only with data from Brazil,
    but also, since 2021, with the Clinical Epidemiology Unit in Uppsala University to power new AI applications for
    ECG analysis using more than one million ECG collected in Stockholm region between 2007 and 2016.

  description: >-
    Mathematical models of dynamic systems are of fundamental importance for science and engineering.
    Linear models of dynamic systems are well understood and are the standard choice for most engineering
    applications. However, pushing the forefront of current engineering technology requires us to better
    understand, model, and control nonlinear systems. With applications ranging from using
    flexible wings for building more efficient airplanes to using amplifiers near the saturation
    region to meet the needs of the future generation of wireless communication.
    My research focus on analysing and developing new methods for identifying  dynamical
    systems and learning its behavior from empirical data. This was the theme of my Master's
    and Ph.D. Thesis and a topic of current research.

    Scipy is a library of numerical routines implemented in the Python programming language. The library contains
    fundamental blocks for solving scientific problems. Several important projects mention it in their development
    (from the first image of a black hole to the first helicopter in Mars).
    My first contribution to SciPy happened while I was taken a master's class in signal processing
    and needed to implement a filter for removing the powerline interference from the signal of ECG exams
    (which was the theme of my final project). I integrated the filter design routine I used in a pull request
    to the SciPy signal processing library, now the function
    <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.iirnotch.html"> "iirnotch"</a>.
    Latter that same year, I contributed with an implementation of a trust-region optimization method, now the method
    <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.minimize-trustexact.html#optimize-minimize-trustexact"> "trust-exact"</a>.
    Interested in continuing contributing to SciPy, I submitted a
    <a href="https://github.com/antonior92/GSoC2017-Scipy">proposal</a>
    to Google Summer of Code to work on algorithms for constrained optimization
    in SciPy. My proposal was accepted, I was sponsored by Google and mentored by three SciPy
    developers (Nikolay Mayorov, Matt Haberland and Ralf Gommes)  through the development of
    a interior point methods for solving nonlinear constrained
    optimization problems. The implementation was based on a similar technique to that of the commercial software KNITRO
    (that was described in research papers by the authors of the solver). The implementation is now integrated to SciPy
    <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.minimize-trustconstr.html">trust-constr</a>. In
    September 2017, because of my contributions to the library, I was invited to join the project in the core
    developer team and participated on the writting of the paper describing the version 1.0 of the library, published
    in Nature Methods.

- name: FPGA-based stereo vision
  start: 2015

  description: >-
    A stereo camera is a camera that captures two (or more images) simultaneously from different viewpoints
    for the purpose of estimating depth. The idea mimics our own eyes, which give us a sense of depth precisely
    because they capture two simultaneous images from different points of view.
    I worked in all stages of the development of stereo camera based on FPGA technology,
    from the image acquisition from an image sensor through an FPGA chip to the several steps
    required to estimate the depth of a scene using a stereo camera: calibration (determination of geometry
    and parameters of the stereo camera); rectification (alignment of the images); correspondence (determination of the
    corresponding points in the two images and the distance between them); and, reconstruction (calculating the
    position of objects by triangulation). The project was develop during my internship at Invent Vision
    development team. The company develops cameras and provides computer vision solutions for industry. At that point
    the company was commissioned to make a decoking monitoring system at an oil refinery. For this task, it was
    interesting to have a cloud of points  containing the internal structure of the refinery drum, which sparked the
    company's interest in stereo vision technology. Working there, I developed a prototype of a stereo camera which is
    described in a monograph I wrote during my undergraduate course as requirement for obtaing the Bachelor degree in
    Electrical Engineering.

  description: >-
    In offshore oil extraction, the instruments located at the bottom of the well undergo a rapid wear due to extreme
    conditions. The maintenance and exchange of such equipment is complicated and expensive. In this context, obtaining
    mathematical models for variables at the bottom of the oil well from platform variables is a simple and
    inexpensive solution. These mathematical models are also called virtual sensors. As a undergraduate student,
    I participated on a research and development project coordinated by professor Luis Ant√¥nio Aguirre fromm
    Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Brasil) together with Petrobras Oil Company together for the development
    of virtual sensors from  historical data of the oil well operation. These virtual sensors could replace
    the measurement instrumented located at the bottom of the production column in offshore oil extraction
    temporarily in case of malfunctioning.
