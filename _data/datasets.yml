  description: SaMi-Trop is an NIH-funded prospective cohort of 1959 patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy
    to evaluate whether a clinical prediction rule based on ECG, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels,
    and other biomarkers can be useful in clinical practice. A subset of the SaMi-Trop dataset with annotations
    of age and mortality and the correspondent ECG traces is openly available here.
