  thesis: Learning nonlinear differentiable models for signals and systems with applications
  description: I was supervised by Luis Antonio Aguirre and co-supervised by Thomas B. Schon.  I stayed one year,
        from Sept. 2018 to Sept. 2019, as a guest doctoral student at Uppsala University (Sweden). My Thesis named
        "Learning nonlinear differentiable models for signals and systems with applications" won the
        award of Best thesis in the Electrical Engineering department and also the best thesis in Engineering and
        Physical Sciences in the University.

  thesis: Implementação de uma Câmera Estéreo
  description: I completed a total of 240  credits (3600 class-hours). And obtained a grade pointed average
               4.91 out of 5.00. My course work included disciplines in control engineering, signal processing,
               eletrical Drives, power eletronics, system identification, electrical circuits, optimization
               and communications.
  note: That is the weighted average of my letter grade (A = 5; B = 4; C = 3; D = 2; E = 1; F = 0) according to the
        course number of credits.
