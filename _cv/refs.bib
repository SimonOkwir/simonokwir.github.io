  abstract = {Recent developments within deep learning are relevant for nonlinear system identification problems. In this paper, we establish connections between the deep learning and the system identification communities. It has recently been shown that convolutional architectures are at least as capable as recurrent architectures when it comes to sequence modeling tasks. Inspired by these results we explore the explicit relationships between the recently proposed temporal convolutional network (TCN) and two classic system identification model structures; Volterra series and block-oriented models. We end the paper with an experimental study where we provide results on two real-world problems, the well-known Silverbox dataset and a newer dataset originating from ground vibration experiments on an F-16 fighter aircraft.},

  abstract = {This study aims to assess whether information derived from the raw 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) combined with clinical information is predictive of atrial fibrillation (AF) development.We use a subset of the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG) database consisting of patients that had repeated 12-lead ECG measurements between 2010-2017 that is 1,130,404 recordings from 415,389 unique patients. Median and interquartile of age for the recordings were 58 (46-69) and 38\% of the patients were males. Recordings were assigned to train-validation and test sets in an 80:20\% split which was stratified by class, age and gender. A random forest classifier was trained to predict, for a given recording, the risk of AF development within 5-years. We use features obtained from different modalities, namely demographics, clinical information, engineered features, and features from deep representation learning.The best model performance on the test set was obtained for the model combining features from all modalities with an AUROC=0.909 against the best single modality model which had an AUROC=0.839.Our study has important clinical implications for AF management. It is the first study integrating feature engineering, deep learning and EMR metadata to create a risk prediction tool for the management of patients at risk of AF. The best model that includes features from all modalities demonstrates that human knowledge in electrophysiology combined with deep learning outperforms any single modality approach. The high performance obtained suggest that structural changes in the 12-lead ECG are associated with existing or impending AF.},

  abstract = {Self-supervised learning is a paradigm that extracts general features which describe the input space by artificially generating labels from the input without the need for explicit annotations. The learned features can then be used by transfer learning to boost the performance on a downstream task. Such methods have recently produced state of the art results in natural language processing and computer vision. Here, we propose a self-supervised learning method for 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). For pretraining the model we design a task to mask out subsegements of all channels of the input signals and try to predict the actual values. As the model architecture, we use a U-ResNet containing an encoder-decoder structure. We test our method by self-supervised pretraining on the CODE dataset and then transfer the learnt features by finetuning on the PTB-XL and CPSC benchmarks to evaluate the effect of our method in the classification of 12-leads ECGs. The method does provide modest improvements in performance when compared to not using pretraining. In future work we will make use of these ideas in smaller dataset, where we believe it can lead to larger performance gains.},

  abstract = {Myocardial infarction diagnosis is a common challenge in the emergency department. In managed settings, deep learning-based models and especially convolutional deep models have shown promise in electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, but there is a lack of high-performing models for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in real-world scenarios. We aimed to train and validate a deep learning model using ECGs to predict myocardial infarction in real-world emergency department patients. We studied emergency department patients in the Stockholm region between 2007 and 2016 that had an ECG obtained because of their presenting complaint. We developed a deep neural network based on convolutional layers similar to a residual network. Inputs to the model were ECG tracing, age, and sex; and outputs were the probabilities of three mutually exclusive classes: non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and control status, as registered in the SWEDEHEART and other registries. We used an ensemble of five models. Among 492,226 ECGs in 214,250 patients, 5,416 were recorded with an NSTEMI, 1,818 a STEMI, and 485,207 without a myocardial infarction. In a random test set, our model could discriminate STEMIs/NSTEMIs from controls with a C-statistic of 0.991/0.832 and had a Brier score of 0.001/0.008. The model obtained a similar performance in a temporally separated test set of the study sample, and achieved a C-statistic of 0.985 and a Brier score of 0.002 in discriminating STEMIs from controls in an external test set. We developed and validated a deep learning model with excellent performance in discriminating between control, STEMI, and NSTEMI on the presenting ECG of a real-world sample of the important population of all-comers to the emergency department. Hence, deep learning models for ECG decision support could be valuable in the emergency department.},

Here we propose that the age predicted by artificial intelligence (AI) from the raw ECG tracing (ECG-age) can be a measure of cardiovascular health and provide prognostic information. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to predict a patient9s age from the 12-lead ECG using data from patients that underwent an ECG from 2010 to 2017 - the CODE study cohort (n=1,558,415 patients). On the 15\% hold-out CODE test split, patients with ECG-age more than 8 years greater than chronological age had a higher mortality rate (hazard ratio (HR) 1.79, p\&lt;0.001) in a mean follow-up of 3.67 years, whereas those with ECG-age more than 8 years less than chronological age had a lower mortality rate (HR 0.78, p\&lt;0.001). Similar results were obtained in the external cohorts ELSA-Brasil (n=14,236) and SaMi-Trop (n=1,631). The ability to predict mortality from the ECG predicted age remains even when we adjust the model for cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, even for apparent normal ECGs, having a predicted ECG-age 8 or more years greater than chronological age remained a statistically significant predictor of risk (HR 1.53, p\&lt;0.001 in CODE 15\% test split). These results show that AI-enabled analysis of the ECG can add prognostic information to the interpretation of the 12-lead ECGs.},

Our method focuses exclusively on automated ECG diagnosis and analyzes the explanation in terms of clinical accuracy for interpretability and robustness. The proposed method uses a noise-insertion strategy to quantify the impact of intervals and segments of the ECG signals on the automated classification outcome. An ECG segmentation method was applied to ECG tracings, to obtain: (1) Intervals, Segments and Axis; (2) Rate, and (3) Rhythm. Noise was added to the signal to disturb the ECG features in a realistic way. The method was tested using Monte Carlo simulation and the feature impact is estimated by the change in the model prediction averaged over 499 executions and a feature is defined as important if its mean value changes the result of the classifier. We demonstrate our method by explaining diagnoses generated by a deep convolutional neural network. The proposed method is particularly effective and useful for modern deep learning models that take raw data as input.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Telehealth system is an important tool to improve access and quality to health assistance.Large electrocardiogram (ECG) databases, linked to mortality or hospitalization data, can be useful in determining the prognostic value of ECG markers. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a public health problem with increasing prevalence as the population ages, associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.Hypothesis: Evaluate the association between the presence of AF with overall and cardiovascular mortality in a large electronic cohort of primary care patients of Minas Gerais.Methods: This is an observational retrospective study. Patients over 16 years old who performed digital electrocardiograms by Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais from 2013 to 2016 were assessed. A probabilistic linkage between data from the national mortality information system and our ECG database was made. Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted by a team of trained cardiologists and automatic software (Glasgow and Minnesota).The diagnosis of AF was considered if there was concordance between the cardiologist{${'}$}s report and one of the automatic systems. In cases of disagreement, ECGs were reviewed manually.Only the first ECG made was analysed. To assess the relation between AF and mortality, Cox regression was used, adjusted by age, sex and clinical conditions.Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,075,531 were included. The mean age was 51.4 years, 40.5\% male.The prevalence of AF was 1.15\%. There were 2.9\% deaths for all causes in 2.69 years of mean follow up. In univariate analysis, AF was a risk factor for death from all causes (HR 6.98, 95\%CI 6.68-7.28). After adjustment for age, sex and comorbidities, AF remained an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR 2.49; 95\% CI 2.39 - 2.61). AF was also a predictor of risk for cardiovascular mortality after adjustment for age, sex and clinical conditions (HR 2.35, 95\% CI 2.01-2.73). In multivariate analysis by sex, adjusted for age and comorbidities, AF women had higher risk of death for all causes (HR 3.06; 95\% CI 2.86-3.26) than men (HR 2.18; 95\% CI 2.06-2.32). There were no difference between sex in cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.34; 95\% CI 2.01-2.73 for male sex e HR 2.49; 95\% CI 2.14-2.90 for female).Conclusions: AF was a strong predictor of mortality for all causes and cardiovascular mortality in primary care population with increased risk in women for deaths for all cause.},

  abstract = {Computerized electrocardiography (ECG) has been widely used and allows linkage to electronic medical records. The present study describes the development and clinical applications of an electronic cohort derived from a digital ECG database obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, for the period 2010\textendash 2017, linked to the mortality data from the national information system, the Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiography (CODE) dataset. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. A total of 1,666,778 (94\%) underwent a valid ECG recording for the period 2010 to 2017, with 1,558,421 patients over 16 years old; 40.2\% were men, with a mean age of 51.7 [SD 17.6] years. During a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the mortality rate was 3.3\%. ECG abnormalities assessed were: atrial fibrillation (AF), right bundle branch block (RBBB), left bundle branch block (LBBB), atrioventricular block (AVB), and ventricular pre-excitation. Most ECG abnormalities (AF: Hazard ratio [HR] 2.10; 95\% CI 2.03\textendash 2.17; RBBB: HR 1.32; 95\%CI 1.27\textendash 1.36; LBBB: HR 1.69; 95\% CI 1.62\textendash 1.76; first degree AVB: Relative survival [RS]: 0.76; 95\% CI0.71\textendash 0.81; 2:1 AVB: RS 0.21 95\% CI0.09\textendash 0.52; and RS 0.36; third degree AVB: 95\% CI 0.26\textendash 0.49) were predictors of overall mortality, except for ventricular pre-excitation (HR 1.41; 95\% CI 0.56\textendash 3.57) and Mobitz I AVB (RS 0.65; 95\% CI 0.34\textendash 1.24). In conclusion, a large ECG database established by a telehealth network can be a useful tool for facilitating new advances in the fields of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology.},

  abstract = {Methods: This observational retrospective study of primary care patients was developed with the digital ECG database from the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil. ECGs performed from 2010 to 2017 were interpreted by cardiologists and the University of Glasgow automated analysis software. An electronic cohort was obtained linking data from ECG exams and those from a national mortality information system, using standard probabilistic linkage methods. We considered only the first ECG of each patient. Patients under 16 years were excluded. Hazard ratios (HR) for mortality were adjusted for demographic and self-reported clinical factors and estimated with Cox regression. Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,558,421 were included, mean age 51.6 years; 40.2\% male. There were 3.34\% deaths from all causes in 3.68 years of median follow up. The prevalence of AF was 1.33\%. AF was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR 2.10, 95\%CI 2.03\textendash 2.17) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.06, 95\%CI 1.86\textendash 2.29). Females with AF had a higher risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality compared with males (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in a primary care population, with increased risk in women.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Aging affects the electrocardiogram (ECG) with a higher incidence of abnormalities in older patients. ECG-age can be predicted by artificial intelligence (AI) and can be used as a measure of cardiovascular health.Hypothesis: ECG-age predicted by AI is a risk factor for overall mortality.Methods: The Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiography (CODE) study is a retrospective cohort with a mean follow-up of 3.67 years.The dataset consists of Brazilian patients, mainly from primary care centers. Two established cohorts, ELSA-Brasil, of Brazilian public servants, and SaMi-Trop, of Chagas disease patients, were used for external validation. 2,322,513 ECGs from 1,558,421 patients over 16 years old that underwent an ECG from 2010 to 2017 were included. A deep convolutional neural network was trained in order to predict the age of the patient based solely on ECG 12-lead tracings. The ECG database was split into 85-15\% training and test datasets, respectively. Death was ascertained using probabilistic linkage with Brazil{${'}$}s mortality information data. The Cox regression model, adjusted by age and sex, was used for statistical analysis. The model was validated in two cohorts: ELSA-Brasil (n=14,263) and SaMi-Trop (n=1,631).Results: he mean predicted ECG-age was 52.0 years ({$\pm$}18.7) with a mean absolute error of 8.38 ({$\pm$}7.0) years. Patients with ECG-age {$>$}8y older than chronological age had higher mortality rate (HR 1.79, 95\%CI 1.69-1.90; p{$<$}0.001), whereas those ECG-age {$>$}8y younger than chronological age were associated with a lower mortality rate (HR 0.78, 95\%CI 0.74-0.83; p{$<$}0.001). These results were similar in ELSA-Brasil and SaMi-Trop external validation cohorts (HR 1.75, 95\%CI 1.35-2.27; p{$<$}0.001;HR 2.42, 95\%CI 1.53-3.83; p{$<$}0.001 for {$>$}8y difference, retrospectively; HR 0.74, 95\%CI 0.63-0.88; p{$<$}0.001;HR 0.89, 95\%CI 0.52-1.54; p=0.68 for {$<$}8y difference, respectively).Conclusions: ECG-age, predicted by AI, can be useful as a tool for risk stratification of mortality.},

Such exams can provide a full evaluation of heart activity and have not been studied in previous end-to-end machine learning papers. Using the database of a large telehealth network, we built a novel dataset with more than 2 million ECG tracings, orders of magnitude larger than those used in previous studies. Moreover, our dataset is more realistic, as it consist of 12-lead ECGs recorded during standard in-clinics exams. Using this data, we trained a residual neural network with 9 convolutional layers to map 7 to 10 second ECG signals to 6 classes of ECG abnormalities. Future work should extend these results to cover a large range of ECG abnormalities, which could improve the accessibility of this diagnostic tool and avoid wrong diagnosis from medical doctors.},

  abstract = {The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a major diagnostic test for cardiovascular diseases and enhanced automated analysis tools might lead to more reliable diagnosis and improved clinical practice. Deep neural networks are models composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples. Inspired by the success of these models in computer vision, we propose an end-to-end approach for the task at hand. We trained deep convolutional neural network models in the heterogeneous dataset provided in the Physionet 2020 Challenge and used an ensemble of seven of these convolutional models for the classification of abnormalities present in the ECG records. Ensembles use the output of multiple models to generate a combined prediction and are known to improve performance and generalization when compared to the individual models. In our submission, we use an ensemble of neural networks with the architecture similar to the one described in Nat Commun 11, 1760 (2020) for 12-lead ECGs classification. On the partially hidden test dataset from the challenge, the best-scored entry for our team (the ``Code Team'') had a performance of 0.657, which place us in the 7-th place team-wise in the challenge leaderboard.},

  abstract = {A stereo camera is a camera that simultaneously captures two or more images  in order to estimate depth. A stereo camera prototype was implemented using two image sensors. Its project was based on v200, a commercial camera produced by Invent Vision (iVision), company for which this prototype was developed. The major steps needed to estimate depth using a stereo camera were followed. They are: calibration (estimation of camera geometry and parameters), retification (aligning images), correspondence (finding correspondent points on the two images and the distance between them) and reconstruction (estimation of features depth using triangulation). All algorithms needed were implemented using C++ and integrated to the prototype. The prototype is able to estimate depth in a range of 0.7 to 20 meters, it has a resolution on the order of a few centimeters and can reach a frame rate of 5 frames per second. The industrial camera v200 has all its internal processing computed by a FPGA. It is suggested, as a future work, to use the FPGA to speed up the retification and correspondence algorithms. The aim of this work was to take a first step towards a stereo camera based on v200 to be a competitive commercial product, apt to be sold by iVision.},

Adversarial attacks are a popular framework for studying these vulnerabilities. In this work, we study the error of linear regression in the face of adversarial attacks. We provide bounds of the error in terms of the traditional risk and the parameter norm and show how these bounds can be leveraged and make it possible to use analysis from non-adversarial setups to study the adversarial risk. The usefulness of these results is illustrated by shedding light on whether or not overparameterized linear models can be adversarially robust. We show that adding features to linear models might be either a source of additional robustness or brittleness. We show that these differences appear due to scaling and how the \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$ and \$\textbackslash ell\_2\$ norms of random projections concentrate. We also show how the reformulation we propose allows for solving adversarial training as a convex optimization problem. This is then used as a tool to study how adversarial training and other regularization methods might affect the robustness of the estimated models.},

  abstract = {Neural network models for dynamic systems can be trained either in parallel or in series-parallel configurations. Influenced by early arguments, several papers justify the choice of series-parallel rather than parallel configuration claiming it has a lower computational cost, better stability properties during training and provides more accurate results. Other published results, on the other hand, defend parallel training as being more robust and capable of yielding more accurate long-term predictions. The main contribution of this paper is to present a study comparing both methods under the same unified framework with special attention to three aspects: (i)~robustness of the estimation in the presence of noise; (ii)~computational cost; and, (iii)~convergence. A unifying mathematical framework and simulation studies show situations where each training method provides superior validation results and suggest that parallel training is generally better in more realistic scenarios. An example using measured data seems to reinforce such a claim. Complexity analysis and numerical examples show that both methods have similar computational cost although series-parallel training is more amenable to parallelization. Some informal discussion about stability and convergence properties is presented and explored in the examples.},

The commonly used approach of minimizing the free-run simulation error is called single shooting in contrast with the new multiple shooting approach proposed in this paper, for which the free-run simulation error of sub-datasets is minimized subject to equality constraints. The names ``single shooting'' and ``multiple shooting'' are used due to the similarities with techniques for estimating ODE (ordinary differential equation) parameters. Examples with nonlinear polynomial models illustrate the advantages of OE models as well as the capability of the multiple shooting approach to avoid undesirable local minima.},

  abstract = {We shed new light on the smoothness of optimization problems arising in prediction error parameter estimation of linear and nonlinear systems. We show that for regions of the parameter space where the model is not contractive, the Lipschitz constant and beta-smoothness of the objective function might blow up exponentially with the simulation length, making it hard to numerically find minima within those regions or, even, to escape from them. In addition to providing theoretical understanding of this problem, this paper also proposes the use of multiple shooting as a viable solution. The proposed method minimizes the error between a prediction model and the observed values. Rather than running the prediction model over the entire dataset, multiple shooting splits the data into smaller subsets and runs the prediction model over each subset, making the simulation length a design parameter and making it possible to solve problems that would be infeasible using a standard approach. The equivalence to the original problem is obtained by including constraints in the optimization. The new method is illustrated by estimating the parameters of nonlinear systems with chaotic or unstable behavior, as well as neural networks. We also present a comparative analysis of the proposed method with multi-step-ahead prediction error minimization.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art machine learning models can be vulnerable to very small input perturbations that are adversarially constructed. Adversarial training is one of the most effective approaches to defend against such examples. We show that for linear regression problems, adversarial training can be formulated as a convex problem. This fact is then used to show that \$\textbackslash ell\_\textbackslash infty\$-adversarial training produces sparse solutions and has many similarities to the lasso method. Similarly, \$\textbackslash ell\_2\$-adversarial training has similarities with ridge regression. We use a robust regression framework to analyze and understand these similarities and also point to some differences. Finally, we show how adversarial training behaves differently from other regularization methods when estimating overparameterized models (i.e., models with more parameters than datapoints). It minimizes a sum of three terms which regularizes the solution, but unlike lasso and ridge regression, it can sharply transition into an interpolation mode. We show that for sufficiently many features or sufficiently small regularization parameters, the learned model perfectly interpolates the training data while still exhibiting good out-of-sample performance.},

The present study describes the development and clinical applications of a large database of such digital ECGs, namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. ECGs obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2010 to 17, were organized in a structured database. A hierarchical free-text machine learning algorithm recognized specific ECG diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow ECG Analysis Program provided Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic statements. The presence of a specific ECG abnormality was considered when both automatic and medical diagnosis were concordant; cases of discordance were decided using heuristisc rules and manual review. The ECG database was linked to the national mortality information system using probabilistic linkage methods. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. After excluding the ECGs with technical problems and patients {$<$}16\,years-old, 1,558,415 patients were studied. High performance measures were obtained using an end-to-end deep neural network trained to detect 6 types of ECG abnormalities, with F1 scores {$>$}80\% and specificity {$>$}99\% in an independent test dataset. We also evaluated the risk of mortality associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all causes, with increased risk in women. In conclusion, a large database that comprises all ECGs performed by a large telehealth network can be useful for further developments in the field of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is associated with a {$>$}8-fold increased risk of heart failure and a 2-fold risk of premature death. The use of ECG signals in screening for LV systolic dysfunction is limited by their availability to clinicians. We developed a novel deep learning\textendash based approach that can use ECG images for the screening of LV systolic dysfunction. METHODS: Using 12-lead ECGs plotted in multiple different formats, and corresponding echocardiographic data recorded within 15 days from the Yale New Haven Hospital between 2015 and 2021, we developed a convolutional neural network algorithm to detect an LV ejection fraction {$<$}40\%. The model was validated within clinical settings at Yale New Haven Hospital and externally on ECG images from Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA; Lake Regional Hospital in Osage Beach, MO; Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital in Houston, TX; and Methodist Cardiology Clinic of San Antonio, TX. In addition, it was validated in the prospective Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping was used to localize class-discriminating signals in ECG images. RESULTS: Overall, 385\,601 ECGs with paired echocardiograms were used for model development. The model demonstrated high discrimination power across various ECG image formats and calibrations in internal validation (area under receiving operation characteristics [AUROCs], 0.91; area under precision-recall curve [AUPRC], 0.55); and external sets of ECG images from Cedars Sinai (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.53), outpatient Yale New Haven Hospital clinics (AUROC, 0.94 and AUPRC, 0.77), Lake Regional Hospital (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.88), Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital (AUROC, 0.91 and AUPRC 0.88), Methodist Cardiology Clinic (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.74), and Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health cohort (AUROC, 0.95 and AUPRC, 0.45). An ECG suggestive of LV systolic dysfunction portended a {$>$}27-fold higher odds of LV systolic dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiogram (odds ratio, 27.5 [95\% CI, 22.3\textendash 33.9] in the held-out set). Class-discriminative patterns localized to the anterior and anteroseptal leads (V2 to V3), corresponding to the left ventricle regardless of the ECG layout. A positive ECG screen in individuals with an LV ejection fraction {$\geq$}40\% at the time of initial assessment was associated with a 3.9-fold increased risk of developing incident LV systolic dysfunction in the future (hazard ratio, 3.9 [95\% CI, 3.3\textendash 4.7]; median follow-up, 3.2 years). CONCLUSIONS: We developed and externally validated a deep learning model that identifies LV systolic dysfunction from ECG images. This approach represents an automated and accessible screening strategy for LV systolic dysfunction, particularly in low-resource settings.},

  abstract = {Objective: Imbalances of the electrolyte concentration levels in the body can lead to catastrophic consequences, but accurate and accessible measurements could improve patient outcomes. While blood tests provide accurate measurements, they are invasive and the laboratory analysis can be slow or inaccessible. In contrast, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely adopted tool which is quick and simple to acquire. However, the problem of estimating continuous electrolyte concentrations directly from ECGs is not well-studied. We therefore investigate if regression methods can be used for accurate ECG-based prediction of electrolyte concentrations. Methods: We explore the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for this task. We analyze the regression performance across four electrolytes, utilizing a novel dataset containing over 290000 ECGs. For improved understanding, we also study the full spectrum from continuous predictions to binary classification of extreme concentration levels. To enhance clinical usefulness, we finally extend to a probabilistic regression approach and evaluate different uncertainty estimates. Results: We find that the performance varies significantly between different electrolytes, which is clinically justified in the interplay of electrolytes and their manifestation in the ECG. We also compare the regression accuracy with that of traditional machine learning models, demonstrating superior performance of DNNs. Conclusion: Discretization can lead to good classification performance, but does not help solve the original problem of predicting continuous concentration levels. While probabilistic regression demonstrates potential practical usefulness, the uncertainty estimates are not particularly well-calibrated. Significance: Our study is a first step towards accurate and reliable ECG-based prediction of electrolyte concentration levels.},

  abstract = {Objective: Over the past few years, deep learning (DL) has been used extensively in research for 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, it is unclear whether the explicit or implicit claims made on DL superiority to the more classical feature engineering (FE) approaches, based on domain knowledge, hold. In addition, it remains unclear whether combining DL with FE may improve performance over a single modality. Methods: To address these research gaps and in-line with recent major experiments, we revisited three tasks: cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis (multiclass-multilabel classification), atrial fibrillation risk prediction (binary classification), and age estimation (regression). We used an overall dataset of 2.3M 12-lead ECG recordings to train the following models for each task: i) a random forest taking FE as input; ii) an end-to-end DL model; and iii) a merged model of FE+DL. Results: FE yielded comparable results to DL while necessitating significantly less data for the two classification tasks. DL outperformed FE for the regression task. For all tasks, merging FE with DL did not improve performance over DL alone. These findings were confirmed on the additional PTB-XL dataset. Conclusion: We found that for traditional 12-lead ECG based diagnosis tasks, DL did not yield a meaningful improvement over FE, while it improved significantly the nontraditional regression task. We also found that combining FE with DL did not improve over DL alone, which suggests that the FE were redundant with the features learned by DL. Significance: Our findings provides important recommendations on 12-lead ECG based machine learning strategy and data regime to choose for a given task. When looking at maximizing performance as the end goal, if the task is nontraditional and a large dataset is available then DL is preferable. If the task is a classical one and/or a small dataset is available then a FE approach may be the better choice.},
