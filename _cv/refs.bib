  abstract = {Recent developments within deep learning are relevant for nonlinear system identification problems. In this paper, we establish connections between the deep learning and the system identification communities. It has recently been shown that convolutional architectures are at least as capable as recurrent architectures when it comes to sequence modeling tasks. Inspired by these results we explore the explicit relationships between the recently proposed temporal convolutional network (TCN) and two classic system identification model structures; Volterra series and block-oriented models. We end the paper with an experimental study where we provide results on two real-world problems, the well-known Silverbox dataset and a newer dataset originating from ground vibration experiments on an F-16 fighter aircraft.},

  abstract = {This study aims to assess whether information derived from the raw 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) combined with clinical information is predictive of atrial fibrillation (AF) development.We use a subset of the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG) database consisting of patients that had repeated 12-lead ECG measurements between 2010-2017 that is 1,130,404 recordings from 415,389 unique patients. Median and interquartile of age for the recordings were 58 (46-69) and 38\% of the patients were males. Recordings were assigned to train-validation and test sets in an 80:20\% split which was stratified by class, age and gender. A random forest classifier was trained to predict, for a given recording, the risk of AF development within 5-years. We use features obtained from different modalities, namely demographics, clinical information, engineered features, and features from deep representation learning.The best model performance on the test set was obtained for the model combining features from all modalities with an AUROC=0.909 against the best single modality model which had an AUROC=0.839.Our study has important clinical implications for AF management. It is the first study integrating feature engineering, deep learning and EMR metadata to create a risk prediction tool for the management of patients at risk of AF. The best model that includes features from all modalities demonstrates that human knowledge in electrophysiology combined with deep learning outperforms any single modality approach. The high performance obtained suggest that structural changes in the 12-lead ECG are associated with existing or impending AF.},

  abstract = {Background: Myocardial infarctions are often missed in the emergency department. Deep learning models have shown promise in ECG classification in managed settings. We postulate that deep learning models can be useful for ECG myocardial infarction discrimination also in real-world emergency department patients with a high suspicion of an acute coronary syndrome.Methods: We studied emergency department patients in the Stockholm region between 2007 and 2016 that had an ECG obtained and were admitted to a coronary care unit. We developed a deep neural network based on convolutional layers similar to a residual network. Inputs were ECG, age and sex; output label was non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and control status as registered in the SWEDEHEART registry by the discharging coronary care unit physician. We used an ensemble of five models.Findings: Of the included 12,311 coronary care unit admissions, 3,993 were recorded with an NSTEMI, 1,340 a STEMI, and 6,978 had not had a myocardial infarction. In a random test set, our model could discriminate STEMIs with fair precision, with a C-statistic of 0.85 and a Brier score of 0.10. Discrimination of NSTEMIs was poorer, with a C-statistic of 0.76 and a Brier score of 0.18. The performance was similar in a temporal test set that did not overlap in time with the training set.Interpretation: We developed and validated a deep learning model with human-level performance in classifying NSTEMI and STEMI on the presenting ECG of a real-world sample of emergency department patients with a high suspicion of an acute coronary syndrome. Deep learning models for ECG decision support could be valuable in the emergency department.Funding: The Kjell and M\"arta Beijer Foundation, Anders Wikl\"of, the Wallenberg AI, AutonomousSystems and Software Program (WASP) funded by the Knut and Alice WallenbergFoundation, and Uppsala University.Declaration of Interest: JS reports stock ownership in companies providing services to Itrim, Amgen, Janssen, Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Boehringer, Bayer, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, outside the submitted work.

  abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most commonly used exam for the screening and evaluation of cardiovascular diseases. Here we propose that the age predicted by artificial intelligence (AI) from the raw ECG tracing (ECG-age) can be a measure of cardiovascular health and provide prognostic information. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to predict a patient9s age from the 12-lead ECG using data from patients that underwent an ECG from 2010 to 2017 - the CODE study cohort (n=1,558,415 patients). On the 15\% hold-out CODE test split, patients with ECG-age more than 8 years greater than chronological age had a higher mortality rate (hazard ratio (HR) 1.79, p\&lt;0.001) in a mean follow-up of 3.67 years, whereas those with ECG-age more than 8 years less than chronological age had a lower mortality rate (HR 0.78, p\&lt;0.001). Similar results were obtained in the external cohorts ELSA-Brasil (n=14,236) and SaMi-Trop (n=1,631). The ability to predict mortality from the ECG predicted age remains even when we adjust the model for cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, even for apparent normal ECGs, having a predicted ECG-age 8 or more years greater than chronological age remained a statistically significant predictor of risk (HR 1.53, p\&lt;0.001 in CODE 15\% test split). These results show that AI-enabled analysis of the ECG can add prognostic information to the interpretation of the 12-lead ECGs.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present a method to explain ``end-toend'' electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classifiers, where the explanations were built along with seniors cardiologist to provide meaningful features to the final users. Our method focuses exclusively on automated ECG diagnosis and analyzes the explanation in terms of clinical accuracy for interpretability and robustness. The proposed method uses a noise-insertion strategy to quantify the impact of intervals and segments of the ECG signals on the automated classification outcome. An ECG segmentation method was applied to ECG tracings, to obtain: (1) Intervals, Segments and Axis; (2) Rate, and (3) Rhythm. Noise was added to the signal to disturb the ECG features in a realistic way. The method was tested using Monte Carlo simulation and the feature impact is estimated by the change in the model prediction averaged over 499 executions and a feature is defined as important if its mean value changes the result of the classifier. We demonstrate our method by explaining diagnoses generated by a deep convolutional neural network. The proposed method is particularly effective and useful for modern deep learning models that take raw data as input.},

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a public health problem with increasing prevalence as the population ages, associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.Hypothesis: Evaluate the association between the presence of AF with overall and cardiovascular mortality in a large electronic cohort of primary care patients of Minas Gerais.Methods: This is an observational retrospective study. Patients over 16 years old who performed digital electrocardiograms by Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais from 2013 to 2016 were assessed. A probabilistic linkage between data from the national mortality information system and our ECG database was made. Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted by a team of trained cardiologists and automatic software (Glasgow and Minnesota).The diagnosis of AF was considered if there was concordance between the cardiologist{${'}$}s report and one of the automatic systems. In cases of disagreement, ECGs were reviewed manually.Only the first ECG made was analysed. To assess the relation between AF and mortality, Cox regression was used, adjusted by age, sex and clinical conditions.Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,075,531 were included. The mean age was 51.4 years, 40.5\% male.The prevalence of AF was 1.15\%. There were 2.9\% deaths for all causes in 2.69 years of mean follow up. In univariate analysis, AF was a risk factor for death from all causes (HR 6.98, 95\%CI 6.68-7.28). After adjustment for age, sex and comorbidities, AF remained an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR 2.49; 95\% CI 2.39 - 2.61). AF was also a predictor of risk for cardiovascular mortality after adjustment for age, sex and clinical conditions (HR 2.35, 95\% CI 2.01-2.73). In multivariate analysis by sex, adjusted for age and comorbidities, AF women had higher risk of death for all causes (HR 3.06; 95\% CI 2.86-3.26) than men (HR 2.18; 95\% CI 2.06-2.32). There were no difference between sex in cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.34; 95\% CI 2.01-2.73 for male sex e HR 2.49; 95\% CI 2.14-2.90 for female).Conclusions: AF was a strong predictor of mortality for all causes and cardiovascular mortality in primary care population with increased risk in women for deaths for all cause.},

From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. A total of 1,666,778 (94\%) underwent a valid ECG recording for the period 2010 to 2017, with 1,558,421 patients over 16 years old; 40.2\% were men, with a mean age of 51.7 [SD 17.6] years. During a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the mortality rate was 3.3\%. ECG abnormalities assessed were: atrial fibrillation (AF), right bundle branch block (RBBB), left bundle branch block (LBBB), atrioventricular block (AVB), and ventricular pre-excitation. Most ECG abnormalities (AF: Hazard ratio [HR] 2.10; 95\% CI 2.03\textendash 2.17; RBBB: HR 1.32; 95\%CI 1.27\textendash 1.36; LBBB: HR 1.69; 95\% CI 1.62\textendash 1.76; first degree AVB: Relative survival [RS]: 0.76; 95\% CI0.71\textendash 0.81; 2:1 AVB: RS 0.21 95\% CI0.09\textendash 0.52; and RS 0.36; third degree AVB: 95\% CI 0.26\textendash 0.49) were predictors of overall mortality, except for ventricular pre-excitation (HR 1.41; 95\% CI 0.56\textendash 3.57) and Mobitz I AVB (RS 0.65; 95\% CI 0.34\textendash 1.24).

These results were similar in ELSA-Brasil and SaMi-Trop external validation cohorts (HR 1.75, 95\%CI 1.35-2.27; p{$<$}0.001;HR 2.42, 95\%CI 1.53-3.83; p{$<$}0.001 for {$>$}8y difference, retrospectively; HR 0.74, 95\%CI 0.63-0.88; p{$<$}0.001;HR 0.89, 95\%CI 0.52-1.54; p=0.68 for {$<$}8y difference, respectively).Conclusions: ECG-age, predicted by AI, can be useful as a tool for risk stratification of mortality.},

Such exams can provide a full evaluation of heart activity and have not been studied in previous end-to-end machine learning papers. Using the database of a large telehealth network, we built a novel dataset with more than 2 million ECG tracings, orders of magnitude larger than those used in previous studies. Moreover, our dataset is more realistic, as it consist of 12-lead ECGs recorded during standard in-clinics exams. Using this data, we trained a residual neural network with 9 convolutional layers to map 7 to 10 second ECG signals to 6 classes of ECG abnormalities. Future work should extend these results to cover a large range of ECG abnormalities, which could improve the accessibility of this diagnostic tool and avoid wrong diagnosis from medical doctors.},

  abstract = {The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a major diagnostic test for cardiovascular diseases and enhanced automated analysis tools might lead to more reliable diagnosis and improved clinical practice. Deep neural networks are models composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples. Inspired by the success of these models in computer vision, we propose an end-to-end approach for the task at hand. We trained deep convolutional neural network models in the heterogeneous dataset provided in the Physionet 2020 Challenge and used an ensemble of seven of these convolutional models for the classification of abnormalities present in the ECG records. Ensembles use the output of multiple models to generate a combined prediction and are known to improve performance and generalization when compared to the individual models. In our submission, we use an ensemble of neural networks with the architecture similar to the one described in Nat Commun 11, 1760 (2020) for 12-lead ECGs classification. On the partially hidden test dataset from the challenge, the best-scored entry for our team (the ``Code Team'') had a performance of 0.657, which place us in the 7-th place team-wise in the challenge leaderboard.},

  abstract = {A stereo camera is a camera that simultaneously captures two or more images  in order to estimate depth. A stereo camera prototype was implemented using two image sensors. Its project was based on v200, a commercial camera produced by Invent Vision (iVision), company for which this prototype was developed. The major steps needed to estimate depth using a stereo camera were followed. They are: calibration (estimation of camera geometry and parameters), retification (aligning images), correspondence (finding correspondent points on the two images and the distance between them) and reconstruction (estimation of features depth using triangulation). All algorithms needed were implemented using C++ and integrated to the prototype. The prototype is able to estimate depth in a range of 0.7 to 20 meters, it has a resolution on the order of a few centimeters and can reach a frame rate of 5 frames per second. The industrial camera v200 has all its internal processing computed by a FPGA. It is suggested, as a future work, to use the FPGA to speed up the retification and correspondence algorithms. The aim of this work was to take a first step towards a stereo camera based on v200 to be a competitive commercial product, apt to be sold by iVision.},

  abstract = {Neural network models for dynamic systems can be trained either in parallel or in series-parallel configurations. Influenced by early arguments, several papers justify the choice of series-parallel rather than parallel configuration claiming it has a lower computational cost, better stability properties during training and provides more accurate results. Other published results, on the other hand, defend parallel training as being more robust and capable of yielding more accurate long-term predictions. The main contribution of this paper is to present a study comparing both methods under the same unified framework with special attention to three aspects: (i)~robustness of the estimation in the presence of noise; (ii)~computational cost; and, (iii)~convergence. A unifying mathematical framework and simulation studies show situations where each training method provides superior validation results and suggest that parallel training is generally better in more realistic scenarios. An example using measured data seems to reinforce such a claim. Complexity analysis and numerical examples show that both methods have similar computational cost although series-parallel training is more amenable to parallelization. Some informal discussion about stability and convergence properties is presented and explored in the examples.},

  abstract = {We shed new light on the smoothness of optimization problems arising in prediction error parameter estimation of linear and nonlinear systems. We show that for regions of the parameter space where the model is not contractive, the Lipschitz constant and beta-smoothness of the objective function might blow up exponentially with the simulation length, making it hard to numerically find minima within those regions or, even, to escape from them. In addition to providing theoretical understanding of this problem, this paper also proposes the use of multiple shooting as a viable solution. The proposed method minimizes the error between a prediction model and the observed values. Rather than running the prediction model over the entire dataset, multiple shooting splits the data into smaller subsets and runs the prediction model over each subset, making the simulation length a design parameter and making it possible to solve problems that would be infeasible using a standard approach. The equivalence to the original problem is obtained by including constraints in the optimization. The new method is illustrated by estimating the parameters of nonlinear systems with chaotic or unstable behavior, as well as neural networks. We also present a comparative analysis of the proposed method with multi-step-ahead prediction error minimization.},

The present study describes the development and clinical applications of a large database of such digital ECGs, namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. ECGs obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2010 to 17, were organized in a structured database. A hierarchical free-text machine learning algorithm recognized specific ECG diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow ECG Analysis Program provided Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic statements. The presence of a specific ECG abnormality was considered when both automatic and medical diagnosis were concordant; cases of discordance were decided using heuristisc rules and manual review. The ECG database was linked to the national mortality information system using probabilistic linkage methods. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. After excluding the ECGs with technical problems and patients {$<$}16 years-old, 1,558,415 patients were studied. High performance measures were obtained using an end-to-end deep neural network trained to detect 6 types of ECG abnormalities, with F1 scores {$>$}80\% and specificity {$>$}99\% in an independent test dataset. We also evaluated the risk of mortality associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all causes, with increased risk in women. In conclusion, a large database that comprises all ECGs performed by a large telehealth network can be useful for further developments in the field of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology.},

We sought to develop a multilabel automated diagnosis model for electrocardiographic images, more suitable for broader use. Methods and Results A total of 2,228,236 12-lead ECGs from 811 municipalities in Minas Gerais, Brazil were sampled into 90\% (training):5\%(validation):5\%(held-out test), and were transformed to ECG images with varying lead locations and formats. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) using an EfficientNet-based architecture on ECG images to identify 6 physician-defined clinical labels spanning rhythm and conduction disorders, as well as a hidden label for gender. We trained another CNN for signal-based classification. The image-based model performed well on the held-out test set (average AUROC 0.99, AUPRC 0.68). This was replicated in a distinct test set from Brazil validated by at least two cardiologists (average AUROC 0.99, AUPRC 0.86) as well as an external validation set of 21,785 ECGs from Germany (average AUROC 0.97, AUPRC 0.73), with performance superior to signal-based models. Expert review of 120 out of 120 high confidence false positive predictions on the held-out and external validation sets were confirmed to be true positives with incorrect labels. The model learned generalizable features, confirmed using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Conclusion We developed an externally validated model that extends the automated diagnosis of key rhythm and conduction disorders to printed ECGs as well as to the identification of hidden features, allowing the application of AI to ECGs captured across broad settings.},
