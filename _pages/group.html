<h1>Research Group</h1>

<p>I am a Researcher and Lecturer at Uppsala University, leading a group focused on operations management, supply chain, circular economy, and the application of artificial intelligence in industrial engineering. Between 2017 and 2023, I supervised over 60 Master and Bachelor students and served as a reviewer and examiner for three PhD defenses. I am currently expanding my group and seeking motivated <strong>MSc, PhD, and postdoctoral candidates</strong> to join our research efforts.</p>
