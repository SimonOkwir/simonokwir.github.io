I received my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of 
Minas Gerais (UFMG) — a top-ranked university in Brazil. In 2016, I joined UFMG
Master’s program, also in Electrical Engineering. Due to my good performance, 
I was directly transferred to the Ph.D. program after a first-year presentation.
During my Ph.D. I was awarded a mobility scholarship and stayed a year at Uppsala
University, working as a Ph.D. student in Thomas Schön’s group. My thesis went on 
to be awarded the best thesis in Engineering and Physical Sciences at UFMG in 2020. 

My Ph.D. work focused on the analysis and deployment of recurrent models. 
It was featured in top venues, including the journals Automatica and Neurocomputing, 
and the premier conference AISTATS. Additionally, since my Ph.D., I have been working 
with an interdisciplinary team of doctors, statisticians, and engineers to develop 
next-generation models to detect abnormalities in the electrocardiogram (ECG) exam.
Through these collaborations, I have found a real-world application to my research in
signal processing and dynamical systems. This effort also resulted in multiple publications,
including two papers in Nature Communications that I am the first or shared first author. 
One of them was highlighted in the 2020 Editor's choice in translational and clinical research
and has more than 50 thousand accesses and 250 citations (according to Google Scholar). 

In 2021, I joined Thomas Schön's group at Uppsala University as a postdoctoral researcher
in the Information Technology department in a position funded by the Beijer foundation. 
One year later, because my reseach, I was awarded the Benzelius Award from the Royal Society 
of Sciences in Uppsala due to my ``contributions to fundamental method development in machine
learning and control technology, as well as its use to solve problems in cardiology''.

I have been closely involved with open science and open-source software. 
After participating in Google Summer of Code 2017, I became a SciPy core 
member and made substantial contributions to one of the world’s largest
scientific computing libraries. I also participated in the elaboration 
of the paper describing the library, which accounts for thousands of citations.
Furthermore, the ECG-related models and datasets made available in my research have 
been widely used by the research community. One of our datasets is, to the best of 
my knowledge, the largest publicly available set of ECG traces. My open approach 
towards science has helped me build an international and interdisciplinary network
of collaboration, having published papers with authors from Technion (Israel), Yale 
(U.S.), University of Glasgow (Scotland), Boston University (U.S), University of
Newcastle (Australia) and Eindhoven University of Technology (The Netherlands).
