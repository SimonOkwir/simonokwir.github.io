 I did my Ph.D. at UFMG, a top-ranked university in Brazil, under the supervision of Luis A. 
 Aguirre. My thesis defended in 2020 went on to be awarded the best thesis in Engineering and
 Physical Sciences by the university. In the next year, I joined Thomas Schön’s group in Uppsala.
 Due to contributions to machine learning and control with applications in cardiology, I was also
 awarded the Benzelius Award, granted by the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala to young 
 researchers.
