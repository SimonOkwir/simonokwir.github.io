I'm postdoctoral fellow in the group of [Thomas Schön](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/index.html)
at [Uppsala University](http://www.it.uu.se/) (Sweden). My general areas of interest are
**machine learning**, **system theory** and **signal processing**. My research focuses
on techniques for extracting information and learning the intrinsic behaviour
of time series, signals and dynamical systems. My research is motivated by 
a range of applications, in particular the ones emerging from 
computational **eletrocardiography**.


I received my Ph.D. in 2020 from [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/international-visitors) (Brasil) under the supervision
[Luis A. Aguirre](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=_zkC6_kAAAAJ&hl=en) 
and [Thomas B. Schön](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/index.html) (who hosted 
me in Uppsala University during part of my studies). I am also a member of
[Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) core development 
team, having contributed to optimization and signal processing packages.
