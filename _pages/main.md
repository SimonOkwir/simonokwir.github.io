I'm a  MSc student in Computer Science at [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais][dcc], Brazil. My current research interests lay in the intersection of machine learning and information networks. I'm particularly interested in:

- The dynamics and the classification of undesirable behaviour, such as *hate speech* and *fake news* in online social networks. 

- Building models that take contextual features (ties, demographic attributes, etc) to classify content in networks (and vice-versa). 

During my undergraduate studies, I explored a wide variety of topics under the supervision of [Wagner Meira][meira], with projects such as [characterizing the video-game livestreaming community on Twitch.tv][2], [improving probabilistic graphical models for gesture and activity recognition][2] and [prototyping a tool for exploring the trajectories of patients with cervical cancer][3]. The latter was the outcome of two internships I did at [Simula][simula] in Oslo, supervised by [Sagar Sen][sagar] and [Mari Nygard][mari]. 

On the industry side I have interned as a software developer at [Microsoft Research Center for SNUI][snui], in Melbourne (where I was an exchange student at [University of Melbourne][unimelb]), and worked on [SweetZpot][sweetzpot], a norwegian-based IoT startup that produces sports sensors.
