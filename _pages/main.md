I'm a Brazilian electrical engineer working towards my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Luis A. Aguirre](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=_zkC6_kAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Thomas Sch√∂n](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/index.html). I am based in Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Brazil) and, from September 2018 to September 2019, I was visiting researcher at Uppsala University (Sweden) in the [system and control division](http://www.it.uu.se/research/systems_and_control).

My current research interests lay in the intersection of machine learning, system theory and signal processing. I am interested in using system theory for better understanding deep neural networks and black box machine learning algorithms. But, also, in studying the application of deep neural networks in areas dominated by classical signal processing and control tools, such as the identification of electromechanical systems and the automated analysis of the electrocardiogram.

I am also a member of [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) core development 
team, having contributed to optimization and signal processing packages with the implementation of filters [``iirnotch``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirnotch.html#scipy.signal.iirnotch), [``irrpeak``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirpeak.html#scipy.signal.iirpeak) and optimization methods [``trust-exact``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-trustexact.html) and [``trust-constr``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-trustconstr.html).
