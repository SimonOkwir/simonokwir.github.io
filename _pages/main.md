I'm a Brazilian electrical engineer working towards my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Luis A. Aguirre](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=_zkC6_kAAAAJ&hl=en). And, until September 2019, I will work at Uppsala University [system and control division](http://www.it.uu.se/research/systems_and_control) as a guest doctoral student, supervised by [Thomas Sch√∂n](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/index.html).

My current research interests lay in the intersection of machine learning, signal processing and control theory. I'm particularly interested in developing new methods for learning and control dynamic systems. During the last years, I've work on research problems such as: [the comparison between different training methods for neural networks dynamic models](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2018.07.071), [the estimation of output error models using multiple shooting](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896317332469) and [the development of methods for choosing data windows to train empirical models](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896315008915). The latter was my contribution to a R&D project with [Petrobras Oil Company](http://www.petrobras.com.br/en/).

I am a member of [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) core development 
team, having contributed to optimization and signal processing packages (implementation of filters [``iirnotch``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirnotch.html#scipy.signal.iirnotch), [``irrpeak``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirpeak.html#scipy.signal.iirpeak) and optimization methods [``trust-exact``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-trustexact.html) and [``trust-constr``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-trustconstr.html)). 

I have also successfully completed [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) under Python organization. My project was the development of an interior-point solver for large-scale nonlinear programming problems, which was integrated to SciPy library under the name of [``trust-constr``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-trustconstr.html).

On the industry side I've worked at [Invent Vision](http://www.ivision.ind.br), a startup that provide computer vision solutions to industrial applications. I was part of the hardware development team and worked designing FPGA-based cameras. The major project I have worked on while there was the design and implementation of a stereo camera.
