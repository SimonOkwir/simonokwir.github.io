I'm a Brazilian electrical engineer working towards my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Luis A. Aguirre](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=_zkC6_kAAAAJ&hl=en) at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. And, until September 2019, I will work at Uppsala University [system and control division](http://www.it.uu.se/research/systems_and_control) as a guest doctoral student, supervised by [Thomas Schön](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/index.html).

My current research interests lay in the intersection of machine learning, signal processing and control theory. I'm particularly interested in developing new methods for learning and control dynamic systems. During the last years, I've worked on both applied and theoretical research problems, such as: 
- [The automatic diagnosis of electrocardiograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12194) - together with the [Telehealth Center from Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais](https://telessaude.hc.ufmg.br/);
- The identification of dynamic models of an oil well - as part of a R&D project with [Petrobras Oil Company](http://www.petrobras.com.br/en/);
- The design and implementation of a FPGA-based stereo camera - during an internship at [Invent Vision](http://www.ivision.ind.br);
- [The comparison between different training methods for neural network dynamic models](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2018.07.071) and [the estimation of output error models using multiple shooting](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896317332469). 

I am also a member of [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) core development 
team, having contributed to optimization and signal processing packages with the implementation of filters [``iirnotch``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirnotch.html#scipy.signal.iirnotch), [``irrpeak``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.iirpeak.html#scipy.signal.iirpeak) and optimization methods [``trust-exact``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-trustexact.html) and [``trust-constr``](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/optimize.minimize-trustconstr.html).  The latter was my [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) project developed under Python organization during 2017.
