I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [Uppsala University](http://www.it.uu.se/) in Sweden. 
My work studies techniques to extract information and  learn the intrinsic behavior of
time series, signals and dynamical systems. I have a focus on large-scale models
that can perform such tasks, with a special interest in their robustness and generalization
capabilities.  While motivated by a range of applications, I am particularly interested in 
the new prospects these advances can bring to medicine. In particular cardiology and 
electrocardiography.
