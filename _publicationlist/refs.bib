  abstract = {In approximately 20 \% of atrial fibrillation (AF)--related ischemic strokes, stroke is the first clinical manifestation of AF. Strategies are needed to identify and therapeutically address previously undetected AF.To quantify the incidence of AF in patients at high risk for but without previously known AF using an insertable cardiac monitor.This prospective, single-arm, multicenter study was conducted from November 2012 to January 2017. Visits took place at 57 centers in the United States and Europe. Patients with a CHADS2 score of 3 or greater (or 2 with at least 1 additional risk factor) were enrolled. Approximately 90 \% had nonspecific symptoms potentially compatible with AF, such as fatigue, dyspnea, and/or palpitations.Patients underwent monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor for 18 to 30 months.The primary end point was adjudicated AF lasting 6 or more minutes and was assessed at 18 months. Other analyses included detection rates at points from 30 days to 30 months and among CHADS2 score subgroups. Median time from insertion to detection and the percentage of patients subsequently prescribed oral anticoagulation therapy was also determined.A total of 446 patients were enrolled; 233 (52.2 \%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 71.5 (9.9) years. A total of 385 patients (86.3 \%) received an insertable cardiac monitor, met the primary analysis cohort definition, and were observed for a mean (SD) period of 22.5 (7.7) months. The detection rate of AF lasting 6 or more minutes at 18 months was 29.3 \%. Detection rates at 30 days and 6, 12, 24, and 30 months were 6.2 \%, 20.4 \%, 27.1 \%, 33.6 \%, and 40.0 \%, respectively. At 18 months, AF incidence was similar among patients with CHADS2 scores of 2 (24.7 \%; 95 \% CI, 17.3-31.4), 3 (32.7 \%; 95 \% CI, 23.8-40.7), and 4 or greater (31.7 \%; 95 \% CI, 22.0-40.3) (P = .23). Median (interquartile) time from device insertion to first AF episode detection was 123 (41-330) days. Of patients meeting the primary end point, 13 (10.2 \%) had 1 or more episodes lasting 24 hours or longer, and oral anticoagulation therapy was prescribed for 72 patients (56.3 \%).The incidence of previously undiagnosed AF may be substantial in patients with risk factors for AF and stroke. Atrial fibrillation would have gone undetected in most patients had monitoring been limited to 30 days. Further trials regarding the value of detecting subclinical AF and of prophylactic therapies are warranted.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01727297}

  abstract = {We propose to study the generalization error of a learned predictor undefined in terms of that of a surrogate (potentially randomized) predictor that is coupled to undefined and designed to trade empirical risk for control of generalization error. In the case where undefined interpolates the data, it is interesting to consider theoretical surrogate predictors that are partially derandomized or rerandomized, e.g., fit to the training data but with modified label noise. We also show that replacing undefined by its conditional distribution with respect to an arbitrary {$\sigma$}-field is a convenient way to derandomize. We study two examples, inspired by the work of Nagarajan and Kolter (2019) and Bartlett et al. (2020), where the learned predictor undefined interpolates the training data with high probability, has small risk, and, yet, does not belong to a nonrandom class with a tight uniform bound on two-sided generalization error. At the same time, we bound the risk of undefined in terms of surrogates constructed by conditioning and denoising, respectively, and shown to belong to nonrandom classes with uniformly small generalization error.},

In this contribution, we apply a computationally attractive prediction error method estimator to a real-data stochastic Wiener-Hammerstein benchmark problem. The estimator is defined using a deterministic predictor that is nonlinear in the input. The prediction error method results in tractable expressions, and Monte Carlo approximations are not necessary. This allows us to tackle several issues considered challenging from the perspective of the current mainstream approach. Under mild conditions, the estimator can be shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. The results of the method applied to the benchmark data are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {Similar to humans and animals, deep artificial neural networks exhibit critical periods during which a temporary stimulus deficit can impair the development of a skill. The extent of the impairment depends on the onset and length of the deficit window, as in animal models, and on the size of the neural network. Deficits that do not affect low-level statistics, such as vertical flipping of the images, have no lasting effect on performance and can be overcome with further training. To better understand this phenomenon, we use the Fisher Information of the weights to measure the effective connectivity between layers of a network during training. Counterintuitively, information rises rapidly in the early phases of training, and then decreases, preventing redistribution of information resources in a phenomenon we refer to as a loss of "Information Plasticity". Our analysis suggests that the first few epochs are critical for the creation of strong connections that are optimal relative to the input data distribution. Once such strong connections are created, they do not appear to change during additional training. These findings suggest that the initial learning transient, under-scrutinized compared to asymptotic behavior, plays a key role in determining the outcome of the training process. Our findings, combined with recent theoretical results in the literature, also suggest that forgetting (decrease of information in the weights) is critical to achieving invariance and disentanglement in representation learning. Finally, critical periods are not restricted to biological systems, but can emerge naturally in learning systems, whether biological or artificial, due to fundamental constrains arising from learning dynamics and information processing.},

This 2.6B parameter neural network is simply trained to minimize perplexity of the next token. We also propose a human evaluation metric called Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA), which captures key elements of a human-like multi-turn conversation. Our experiments show strong correlation between perplexity and SSA. The fact that the best perplexity end-to-end trained Meena scores high on SSA (72\% on multi-turn evaluation) suggests that a human-level SSA of 86\% is potentially within reach if we can better optimize perplexity. Additionally, the full version of Meena (with a filtering mechanism and tuned decoding) scores 79\% SSA, 23\% higher in absolute SSA than the existing chatbots we evaluated.},

  abstract = {Modern deep learning models employ considerably more parameters than required to fit the training data. Whereas conventional statistical wisdom suggests such models should drastically overfit, in practice these models generalize remarkably well. An emerging paradigm for describing this unexpected behavior is in terms of a double descent curve, in which increasing a model's capacity causes its test error to first decrease, then increase to a maximum near the interpolation threshold, and then decrease again in the overparameterized regime. Recent efforts to explain this phenomenon theoretically have focused on simple settings, such as linear regression or kernel regression with unstructured random features, which we argue are too coarse to reveal important nuances of actual neural networks. We provide a precise high-dimensional asymptotic analysis of generalization under kernel regression with the Neural Tangent Kernel, which characterizes the behavior of wide neural networks optimized with gradient descent. Our results reveal that the test error has non-monotonic behavior deep in the overparameterized regime and can even exhibit additional peaks and descents when the number of parameters scales quadratically with the dataset size.},

While this paradigm has inspired significant research on the properties of large networks, relatively little work has been devoted to the fact that these networks are often used to model large complex datasets, which may themselves contain millions or even billions of constraints. In this work, we focus on this high-dimensional regime in which both the dataset size and the number of features tend to infinity. We analyze the performance of a simple regression model trained on the random features \$F=f(WX+B)\$ for a random weight matrix \$W\$ and random bias vector \$B\$, obtaining an exact formula for the asymptotic training error on a noisy autoencoding task. The role of the bias can be understood as parameterizing a distribution over activation functions, and our analysis directly generalizes to such distributions, even those not expressible with a traditional additive bias. Intriguingly, we find that a mixture of nonlinearities can outperform the best single nonlinearity on the noisy autoecndoing task, suggesting that mixtures of nonlinearities might be useful for approximate kernel methods or neural network architecture design.},

This method provides a useful inductive bias for certain problems, but existing software for differentiable optimization layers is rigid and difficult to apply to new settings. In this paper, we propose an approach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of convex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for convex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a subset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined parametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map from parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver's solution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as affine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently differentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end analytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our methodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex optimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined convex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. Our implementation significantly lowers the barrier to using convex optimization problems in differentiable programs. We present applications in linear machine learning models and in stochastic control, and we show that our layer is competitive (in execution time) compared to specialized differentiable solvers from past work.},

The device installed in order to measure this variable is often called a Permanent Downhole Gauge (PDG). Replacing a faulty PDG is often not economically viable and to have an alternative estimate of the downhole pressure is an important goal. Using data from operating PDGs, this paper describes a number of issues dealt with in the development of soft sensors for several deepwater gas-lifted oil wells. Some of the tested models include nonlinear polynomials, neural networks, committee machines, unscented Kalman filters and filter banks. The variety of model classes used in addition to the diversity of oil wells considered brings to light some of the key-problems that have to be faced and reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each alternative solution. A major constraint throughout the work was the use of historical data, hence no specific tests were performed at any time. The aim of this work is to discuss the procedures, pros and cons of the tested solutions and to point to possible future directions of research.},

A total of 66,405 recordings were sourced from hospital systems from four distinct countries and annotated with clinical diagnoses, including 43,101 annotated recordings that were posted publicly. For this Challenge, we asked participants to design working, open-source algorithms for identifying cardiac abnormalities in 12-lead ECG recordings. This Challenge provided several innovations. First, we sourced data from multiple institutions from around the world with different demographics, allowing us to assess the generalizability of the algorithms. Second, we required participants to submit both their trained models and the code for reproducing their trained models from the training data, which aids the generalizability and reproducibility of the algorithms. Third, we proposed a novel evaluation metric that considers different misclassification errors for different cardiac abnormalities, reflecting the clinical reality that some diagnoses have similar outcomes and varying risks. Over 200 teams submitted 850 algorithms (432 of which successfully ran) during the unofficial and official phases of the Challenge, representing a diversity of approaches from both academia and industry for identifying cardiac abnormalities. The official phase of the Challenge is ongoing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {PROBLEM: The Brazilian population lacks equitable access to specialized health care and diagnostic tests, especially in remote municipalities, where health professionals often feel isolated and staff turnover is high. Telehealth has the potential to improve patients' access to specialized health care, but little is known about it in terms of cost-effectiveness, access to services or user satisfaction. APPROACH: In 2005, the State Government of Minas Gerais, Brazil, funded the establishment of the Telehealth Network, intended to connect university hospitals with the state's remote municipal health departments; support professionals in providing tele-assistance; and perform tele-electrocardiography and teleconsultations. The network uses low-cost equipment and has employed various strategies to overcome the barriers to telehealth use. LOCAL SETTING: The Telehealth Network connects specialists in state university hospitals with primary health-care professionals in 608 municipalities of the large state of Minas Gerais, many of them in remote areas. RELEVANT CHANGES: From June 2006 to October 2011, 782,773 electrocardiograms and 30 883 teleconsultations were performed through the network, and 6000 health professionals were trained in its use. Most of these professionals (97\%) were satisfied with the system, which was cost-effective, economically viable and averted 81\% of potential case referrals to distant centres. LESSONS LEARNT: To succeed, a telehealth service must be part of a collaborative network, meet the real needs of local health professionals, use simple technology and have at least some face-to-face components. If applied to health problems for which care is in high demand, this type of service can be economically viable and can help to improve patient access to specialized health care.}

On the theoretical side, a long line of works has been focusing on training neural networks with one hidden layer. The theory of multi-layer networks remains largely unsettled. In this work, we prove why stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can find \${\textbackslash}textit\{global minima\}\$ on the training objective of DNNs in \${\textbackslash}textit\{polynomial time\}\$. We only make two assumptions: the inputs are non-degenerate and the network is over-parameterized. The latter means the network width is sufficiently large: \${\textbackslash}textit\{polynomial\}\$ in \$L\$, the number of layers and in \$n\$, the number of samples. Our key technique is to derive that, in a sufficiently large neighborhood of the random initialization, the optimization landscape is almost-convex and semi-smooth even with ReLU activations. This implies an equivalence between over-parameterized neural networks and neural tangent kernel (NTK) in the finite (and polynomial) width setting. As concrete examples, starting from randomly initialized weights, we prove that SGD can attain 100\% training accuracy in classification tasks, or minimize regression loss in linear convergence speed, with running time polynomial in \$n,L\$. Our theory applies to the widely-used but non-smooth ReLU activation, and to any smooth and possibly non-convex loss functions. In terms of network architectures, our theory at least applies to fully-connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and residual neural networks (ResNet).},

  abstract = {BackgroundTools for the prediction of atrial fibrillation (AF) may identify high-risk individuals more likely to benefit from preventive interventions and serve as a benchmark to test novel putative risk factors.Methods and ResultsIndividual-level data from 3 large cohorts in the United States (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities [ARIC] study, the Cardiovascular Health Study [CHS], and the Framingham Heart Study [FHS]), including 18~556 men and women aged 46 to 94~years (19\% African Americans, 81\% whites) were pooled to derive predictive models for AF using clinical variables. Validation of the derived models was performed in 7672 participants from the Age, Gene and Environment---Reykjavik study (AGES) and the Rotterdam Study (RS). The analysis included 1186 incident AF cases in the derivation cohorts and 585 in the validation cohorts. A simple 5-year predictive model including the variables age, race, height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, current smoking, use of antihypertensive medication, diabetes, and history of myocardial infarction and heart failure had good discrimination (C-statistic, 0.765; 95\% CI, 0.748 to 0.781). Addition of variables from the electrocardiogram did not improve the overall model discrimination (C-statistic, 0.767; 95\% CI, 0.750 to 0.783; categorical net reclassification improvement, -0.0032; 95\% CI, -0.0178 to 0.0113). In the validation cohorts, discrimination was acceptable (AGES C-statistic, 0.664; 95\% CI, 0.632 to 0.697 and RS C-statistic, 0.705; 95\% CI, 0.664 to 0.747) and calibration was adequate.ConclusionA risk model including variables readily available in primary care settings adequately predicted AF in diverse populations from the United States and Europe.},

  abstract = {In this article, we address the problem of risk assessment of stealthy attacks on uncertain control systems. Considering data injection attacks that aim at maximizing impact while remaining undetected, we use the recently proposed output-to-output gain to characterize the risk associated with the impact of attacks in two setups: A full system knowledge attacker and a limited system knowledge attacker. The risk in each setup is formulated using a well-established risk metric, namely the Value-at-Risk and the maximum expected loss, respectively. Under these setups, the risk assessment problem corresponds to an untractable infinite non-convex optimization problem. To address this limitation, we adopt the framework of scenario-based optimization to approximate the infinite non-convex optimization problem by a sampled non-convex optimization problem. Then, based on the framework of dissipative system theory and S-procedure, the sampled non-convex risk assessment problem is formulated as an equivalent convex semi-definite program. Additionally, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the risk to be bounded. Finally, we illustrate the results through numerical simulation of a hydro-turbine power system.},

Although asymptotic convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, the performance of these algorithms is unreliable when the proposal distributions that are used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how it is possible to build efficient high dimensional proposal distributions by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical models where this was not previously so. We demonstrate these algorithms on a non-linear state space model and a L{\'e}vy-driven stochastic volatility model.},

We present empirical observations that commonly used large step sizes (i) lead the iterates to jump from one side of a valley to the other causing loss stabilization, and (ii) this stabilization induces a hidden stochastic dynamics orthogonal to the bouncing directions that biases it implicitly toward simple predictors. Furthermore, we show empirically that the longer large step sizes keep SGD high in the loss landscape valleys, the better the implicit regularization can operate and find sparse representations. Notably, no explicit regularization is used so that the regularization effect comes solely from the SGD training dynamics influenced by the step size schedule. Therefore, these observations unveil how, through the step size schedules, both gradient and noise drive together the SGD dynamics through the loss landscape of neural networks. We justify these findings theoretically through the study of simple neural network models as well as qualitative arguments inspired from stochastic processes. Finally, this analysis allows to shed a new light on some common practice and observed phenomena when training neural networks.

Critically, the sets are valid in a distribution-free sense: they possess explicit, non-asymptotic guarantees even without distributional assumptions or model assumptions. One can use conformal prediction with any pre-trained model, such as a neural network, to produce sets that are guaranteed to contain the ground truth with a user-specified probability, such as 90\%. It is easy-to-understand, easy-to-use, and general, applying naturally to problems arising in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, and so on.},

In this report, the authors delineate the study's objectives, principal methodological features, and timeline. At baseline, ELSA-Brasil enrolled 15,105 civil servants from 5 universities and 1 research institute. The baseline examination (2008--2010) included detailed interviews, clinical and anthropometric examinations, an oral glucose tolerance test, overnight urine collection, a 12-lead resting electrocardiogram, measurement of carotid intima-media thickness, echocardiography, measurement of pulse wave velocity, hepatic ultrasonography, retinal fundus photography, and an analysis of heart rate variability. Long-term biologic sample storage will allow investigation of biomarkers that may predict cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Annual telephone surveillance, initiated in 2009, will continue for the duration of the study. A follow-up examination is scheduled for 2012--2013.}

In this paper, we explore the generality of this phenomenon and make the following contributions. First, we prove a super-linear lower bound on the dimension (in terms of sample size) required for support vector proliferation in independent feature models, matching the upper bounds from previous works. We further identify a sharp phase transition in Gaussian feature models, bound the width of this transition, and give experimental support for its universality. Finally, we hypothesize that this phase transition occurs only in much higher-dimensional settings in the \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ variant of the SVM, and we present a new geometric characterization of the problem that may elucidate this phenomenon for the general \${\textbackslash}ell\_p\$ case.},

Convergence at a linear rate is guaranteed when the following hold: (i) dimensions of hidden layers are at least the minimum of the input and output dimensions; (ii) weight matrices at initialization are approximately balanced; and (iii) the initial loss is smaller than the loss of any rank-deficient solution. The assumptions on initialization (conditions (ii) and (iii)) are necessary, in the sense that violating any one of them may lead to convergence failure. Moreover, in the important case of output dimension 1, i.e. scalar regression, they are met, and thus convergence to global optimum holds, with constant probability under a random initialization scheme.

ICLR'17]. (ii) Generalization bound independent of network size, using a data-dependent complexity measure. Our measure distinguishes clearly between random labels and true labels on MNIST and CIFAR, as shown by experiments. Moreover, recent papers require sample complexity to increase (slowly) with the size, while our sample complexity is completely independent of the network size. (iii) Learnability of a broad class of smooth functions by 2-layer ReLU nets trained via gradient descent.

  abstract = {Summary Background Atrial fibrillation is frequently asymptomatic and thus underdetected but is associated with stroke, heart failure, and death. Existing screening methods require prolonged monitoring and are limited by cost and low yield. We aimed to develop a rapid, inexpensive, point-of-care means of identifying patients with atrial fibrillation using machine learning. Methods We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiograph (ECG) using a convolutional neural network to detect the electrocardiographic signature of atrial fibrillation present during normal sinus rhythm using standard 10-second, 12-lead ECGs. We included all patients aged 18 years or older with at least one digital, normal sinus rhythm, standard 10-second, 12-lead ECG acquired in the supine position at the Mayo Clinic ECG laboratory between Dec 31, 1993, and July 21, 2017, with rhythm labels validated by trained personnel under cardiologist supervision. We classified patients with at least one ECG with a rhythm of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter as positive for atrial fibrillation. We allocated ECGs to the training, internal validation, and testing datasets in a 7:1:2 ratio. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operatoring characteristic curve for the internal validation dataset to select a probability threshold, which we applied to the testing dataset. We evaluated model performance on the testing dataset by calculating the AUC and the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score with two-sided 95\% CIs. Findings We included 180\hphantom{,}922 patients with 649\hphantom{,}931 normal sinus rhythm ECGs for analysis: 454\hphantom{,}789 ECGs recorded from 126\hphantom{,}526 patients in the training dataset, 64\hphantom{,}340 ECGs from 18\hphantom{,}116 patients in the internal validation dataset, and 130\hphantom{,}802 ECGs from 36\hphantom{,}280 patients in the testing dataset. 3051 (8{$\cdot$}4\%) patients in the testing dataset had verified atrial fibrillation before the normal sinus rhythm ECG tested by the model. A single AI-enabled ECG identified atrial fibrillation with an AUC of 0{$\cdot$}87 (95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}86--0{$\cdot$}88), sensitivity of 79{$\cdot$}0\% (77{$\cdot$}5--80{$\cdot$}4), specificity of 79{$\cdot$}5\% (79{$\cdot$}0--79{$\cdot$}9), F1 score of 39{$\cdot$}2\% (38{$\cdot$}1--40{$\cdot$}3), and overall accuracy of 79{$\cdot$}4\% (79{$\cdot$}0--79{$\cdot$}9). Including all ECGs acquired during the first month of each patient's window of interest (ie, the study start date or 31 days before the first recorded atrial fibrillation ECG) increased the AUC to 0{$\cdot$}90 (0{$\cdot$}90--0{$\cdot$}91), sensitivity to 82{$\cdot$}3\% (80{$\cdot$}9--83{$\cdot$}6), specificity to 83{$\cdot$}4\% (83{$\cdot$}0--83{$\cdot$}8), F1 score to 45{$\cdot$}4\% (44{$\cdot$}2--46{$\cdot$}5), and overall accuracy to 83{$\cdot$}3\% (83{$\cdot$}0--83{$\cdot$}7). Interpretation An AI-enabled ECG acquired during normal sinus rhythm permits identification at point of care of individuals with atrial fibrillation. Funding None.},

An inexpensive, noninvasive screening tool for ALVD in the doctor's office is not available. We tested the hypothesis that application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the electrocardiogram (ECG), a routine method of measuring the heart's electrical activity, could identify ALVD. Using paired 12-lead ECG and echocardiogram data, including the left ventricular ejection fraction (a measure of contractile function), from 44,959 patients at the Mayo Clinic, we trained a convolutional neural network to identify patients with ventricular dysfunction, defined as ejection fraction {$\leq$}35\%, using the ECG data alone. When tested on an independent set of 52,870 patients, the network model yielded values for the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.93, 86.3\%, 85.7\%, and 85.7\%, respectively. In patients without ventricular dysfunction, those with a positive AI screen were at 4 times the risk (hazard ratio, 4.1; 95\% confidence interval, 3.3 to 5.0) of developing future ventricular dysfunction compared with those with a negative screen. Application of AI to the ECG---a ubiquitous, low-cost test---permits the ECG to serve as a powerful screening tool in asymptomatic individuals to identify ALVD.},

  abstract = {Background:Sex and age have long been known to affect the ECG. Several biologic variables and anatomic factors may contribute to sex and age-related differences on the ECG. We hypothesized that a convolutional neural network (CNN) could be trained through a process called deep learning to predict a person's age and self-reported sex using only 12-lead ECG signals. We further hypothesized that discrepancies between CNN-predicted age and chronological age may serve as a physiological measure of health.Methods:We trained CNNs using 10-second samples of 12-lead ECG signals from 499\,727 patients to predict sex and age. The networks were tested on a separate cohort of 275\,056 patients. Subsequently, 100 randomly selected patients with multiple ECGs over the course of decades were identified to assess within-individual accuracy of CNN age estimation.Results:Of 275\,056 patients tested, 52\% were males and mean age was 58.6{\textpm}16.2 years. For sex classification, the model obtained 90.4\% classification accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.97 in the independent test data. Age was estimated as a continuous variable with an average error of 6.9{\textpm}5.6 years (R-squared =0.7). Among 100 patients with multiple ECGs over the course of at least 2 decades of life, most patients (51\%) had an average error between real age and CNN-predicted age of {$<$}7 years. Major factors seen among patients with a CNN-predicted age that exceeded chronologic age by {$>$}7 years included: low ejection fraction, hypertension, and coronary disease (P{$<$}0.01). In the 27\% of patients where correlation was {$>$}0.8 between CNN-predicted and chronologic age, no incident events occurred over follow-up (33{\textpm}12 years).Conclusions:Applying artificial intelligence to the ECG allows prediction of patient sex and estimation of age. The ability of an artificial intelligence algorithm to determine physiological age, with further validation, may serve as a measure of overall health.},

  abstract = {The electrocardiography (ECG) and vectocardiography (VCG) both describe the same phenomena: the temporal changes of the surface potentials resulting from cardiac electrical field. The ECG uses 12 leads positioned as it was found optimal from the medical point of view during a hundred years of practice. The VCG uses 3 channels connected to the psuedoorthogonal leads that placement is determined by the orthogonality of main Cartesian axes - in consequence a three-dimensional recording is performed. This paper is devoted to the experimental verification of the likeness of the data provided by both recording techniques. Two different transforms re-mapping the ECG to the VCG domain and viceversa were studied with use of the set of 125 simultaneous ECG and VCG signals from the CSE Multilead Database. One of the possible technical interests of transforming the ECG signals to the VCG domain is reducing the data volume thanks to eliminating the information redundancy typical for ECG. Our results demonstrate that the forward and inverse transform has no perfect reconstruction property and some extent of distortion should be considered when applying this technique to the signal compression.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly assumed to be invariant to small image transformations: either because of the convolutional architecture or because they were trained using data augmentation. Recently, several authors have shown that this is not the case: small translations or rescalings of the input image can drastically change the network's prediction. In this paper, we quantify this phenomena and ask why neither the convolutional architecture nor data augmentation are sufficient to achieve the desired invariance. Specifically, we show that the convolutional architecture does not give invariance since architectures ignore the classical sampling theorem, and data augmentation does not give invariance because the CNNs learn to be invariant to transformations only for images that are very similar to typical images from the training set. We discuss two possible solutions to this problem: (1) antialiasing the intermediate representations and (2) increasing data augmentation and show that they provide only a partial solution at best. Taken together, our results indicate that the problem of insuring invariance to small image transformations in neural networks while preserving high accuracy remains unsolved.},

  abstract = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

Such a method is equivalent to running an infinite depth (weight-tied) feedforward network, but has the notable advantage that we can analytically backpropagate through the equilibrium point using implicit differentiation. Using this approach, training and prediction in these networks require only constant memory, regardless of the effective "depth" of the network. We demonstrate how DEQs can be applied to two state-of-the-art deep sequence models: self-attention transformers and trellis networks. On large-scale language modeling tasks, such as the WikiText-103 benchmark, we show that DEQs 1) often improve performance over these state-of-the-art models (for similar parameter counts); 2) have similar computational requirements as existing models; and 3) vastly reduce memory consumption (often the bottleneck for training large sequence models), demonstrating an up-to 88\% memory reduction in our experiments.

Thus trellis networks with general weight matrices generalize truncated recurrent networks. We leverage these connections to design high-performing trellis networks that absorb structural and algorithmic elements from both recurrent and convolutional models.

  abstract = {Accurate identification of prostate cancer in frozen sections at the time of surgery can be challenging, limiting the surgeon's ability to best determine resection margins during prostatectomy. We performed desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) on 54 banked human cancerous and normal prostate tissue specimens to investigate the spatial distribution of a wide variety of small metabolites, carbohydrates, and lipids. In contrast to several previous studies, our method included Krebs cycle intermediates (m/z {$<$}200), which we found to be highly informative in distinguishing cancer from benign tissue. Malignant prostate cells showed marked metabolic derangements compared with their benign counterparts. Using the ``Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator'' (Lasso), we analyzed all metabolites from the DESI-MS data and identified parsimonious sets of metabolic profiles for distinguishing between cancer and normal tissue. In an independent set of samples, we could use these models to classify prostate cancer from benign specimens with nearly 90\% accuracy per patient. Based on previous work in prostate cancer showing that glucose levels are high while citrate is low, we found that measurement of the glucose/citrate ion signal ratio accurately predicted cancer when this ratio exceeds 1.0 and normal prostate when the ratio is less than 0.5. After brief tissue preparation, the glucose/citrate ratio can be recorded on a tissue sample in 1 min or less, which is in sharp contrast to the 20 min or more required by histopathological examination of frozen tissue specimens.},

  abstract = {Neural network compression techniques have become increasingly popular as they can drastically reduce the storage and computation requirements for very large networks. Recent empirical studies have illustrated that even simple pruning strategies can be surprisingly effective, and several theoretical studies have shown that compressible networks (in specific senses) should achieve a low generalization error. Yet, a theoretical characterization of the underlying cause that makes the networks amenable to such simple compression schemes is still missing. In this study, we address this fundamental question and reveal that the dynamics of the training algorithm has a key role in obtaining such compressible networks. Focusing our attention on stochastic gradient descent (SGD), our main contribution is to link compressibility to two recently established properties of SGD: (i) as the network size goes to infinity, the system can converge to a mean-field limit, where the network weights behave independently, (ii) for a large step-size/batch-size ratio, the SGD iterates can converge to a heavy-tailed stationary distribution. In the case where these two phenomena occur simultaneously, we prove that the networks are guaranteed to be '\${\textbackslash}ell\_p\$-compressible', and the compression errors of different pruning techniques (magnitude, singular value, or node pruning) become arbitrarily small as the network size increases. We further prove generalization bounds adapted to our theoretical framework, which indeed confirm that the generalization error will be lower for more compressible networks. Our theory and numerical study on various neural networks show that large step-size/batch-size ratios introduce heavy-tails, which, in combination with overparametrization, result in compressibility.},

For networks of constant depth and with a large range of widths (for instance, it suffices if the width of each layer is polynomial in that of any other layer), small perturbations of input vectors lead to large changes of outputs. This generalizes results of Daniely and Schacham (2020) for networks of rapidly decreasing width and of Bubeck et al (2021) for two-layer networks. Our proof shows that adversarial examples arise in these networks because the functions they compute are locally very similar to random linear functions. Bottleneck layers play a key role: the minimal width up to some point in the network determines scales and sensitivities of mappings computed up to that point. The main result is for networks with constant depth, but we also show that some constraint on depth is necessary for a result of this kind, because there are suitably deep networks that, with constant probability, compute a function that is close to constant.},

Motivated by this phenomenon, we consider when a perfect fit to training data in linear regression is compatible with accurate prediction. We give a characterization of linear regression problems for which the minimum norm interpolating prediction rule has near-optimal prediction accuracy. The characterization is in terms of two notions of the effective rank of the data covariance. It shows that overparameterization is essential for benign overfitting in this setting: the number of directions in parameter space that are unimportant for prediction must significantly exceed the sample size. By studying examples of data covariance properties that this characterization shows are required for benign overfitting, we find an important role for finite-dimensional data: the accuracy of the minimum norm interpolating prediction rule approaches the best possible accuracy for a much narrower range of properties of the data distribution when the data lie in an infinite-dimensional space vs. when the data lie in a finite-dimensional space with dimension that grows faster than the sample size.},

  abstract = {The remarkable practical success of deep learning has revealed some major surprises from a theoretical perspective. In particular, simple gradient methods easily find near-optimal solutions to non-convex optimization problems, and despite giving a near-perfect fit to training data without any explicit effort to control model complexity, these methods exhibit excellent predictive accuracy. We conjecture that specific principles underlie these phenomena: that overparametrization allows gradient methods to find interpolating solutions, that these methods implicitly impose regularization, and that overparametrization leads to benign overfitting. We survey recent theoretical progress that provides examples illustrating these principles in simpler settings. We first review classical uniform convergence results and why they fall short of explaining aspects of the behavior of deep learning methods. We give examples of implicit regularization in simple settings, where gradient methods lead to minimal norm functions that perfectly fit the training data. Then we review prediction methods that exhibit benign overfitting, focusing on regression problems with quadratic loss. For these methods, we can decompose the prediction rule into a simple component that is useful for prediction and a spiky component that is useful for overfitting but, in a favorable setting, does not harm prediction accuracy. We focus specifically on the linear regime for neural networks, where the network can be approximated by a linear model. In this regime, we demonstrate the success of gradient flow, and we consider benign overfitting with two-layer networks, giving an exact asymptotic analysis that precisely demonstrates the impact of overparametrization. We conclude by highlighting the key challenges that arise in extending these insights to realistic deep learning settings.},

However, theoretical studies in high-dimensional statistics to date rely primarily on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. In this work, we focus on stable Gaussian processes and investigate the theoretical properties of \${\textbackslash}ell \_1\$-regularized estimates in two important statistical problems in the context of high-dimensional time series: (a) stochastic regression with serially correlated errors and (b) transition matrix estimation in vector autoregressive (VAR) models. We derive nonasymptotic upper bounds on the estimation errors of the regularized estimates and establish that consistent estimation under high-dimensional scaling is possible via \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-regularization for a large class of stable processes under sparsity constraints. A key technical contribution of the work is to introduce a measure of stability for stationary processes using their spectral properties that provides insight into the effect of dependence on the accuracy of the regularized estimates. With this proposed stability measure, we establish some useful deviation bounds for dependent data, which can be used to study several important regularized estimates in a time series setting.},

It is then shown how, by introducing the notion of divisibility into this algorithm, a numerical Gr{\"o}bner basis can also be computed. In addition, we demonstrate how the canonical decomposition can be used to decide whether the affine solution set of a multivariate polynomial system is zero-dimensional and to solve the ideal membership problem numerically. The SVD-based canonical decomposition algorithm is also extended to numerically compute border bases. A tolerance for each of the algorithms is derived using perturbation theory of principal angles. This derivation shows that the condition number of computing the canonical decomposition and numerical Gr{\"o}bner basis is essentially the condition number of the Macaulay matrix.

  abstract = {We consider the class of iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithms (ISTA) for solving linear inverse problems arising in signal/image processing. This class of methods, which can be viewed as an extension of the classical gradient algorithm, is attractive due to its simplicity and thus is adequate for solving large-scale problems even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be significantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising numerical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As increasing amounts of personal information are being collected through a plethora of electronic modalities by statutory and non-statutory organizations, ensuring the confidentiality and security of such information has become a major issue globally. While the use of many of these media can be beneficial to individuals or populations, they can also be open to abuse by individuals or statutory and non-statutory organizations. Recent examples include collection of personal information by national security systems and the development of national programs like the Chinese Social Credit System. In many low- and middle-income countries, an increasing amount of personal health information is being collected. The collection of personal health information is necessary, in order to develop longitudinal medical records and to monitor and evaluate the use, cost, outcome, and impact of health services at facility, sub-national, and national levels. However, if personal health information is not held confidentially and securely, individuals with communicable or non-communicable diseases (NCDs) may be reluctant to use preventive or therapeutic health services, due to fear of being stigmatized or discriminated against. While policymakers and other stakeholders in these countries recognize the need to develop and implement policies for protecting the privacy, confidentiality and security of personal health information, to date few of these countries have developed, let alone implemented, coherent policies. The global HIV response continues to emphasize the importance of collecting HIV-health information, recently re-iterated by the Fast Track to End AIDS by 2030 program and the recent changes in the Guidelines on When to Start Antiretroviral Therapy and on Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for HIV. The success of developing HIV treatment cascades in low- and middle-income countries will require the development of National Health Identification Systems. The success of programs like Universal Health Coverage, under the recently ratified Sustainable Development Goals is also contingent on the availability of personal health information for communicable and non-communicable diseases. DESIGN: Guidance for countries to develop and implement their own guidelines for protecting HIV-information formed the basis of identifying a number of fundamental principles, governing the areas of privacy, confidentiality and security. The use of individual-level data must balance maximizing the benefits from their most effective and fullest use, and minimizing harm resulting from their malicious or inadvertent release. DISCUSSION: These general principles are described in this paper, as along with a bibliography referring to more detailed technical information. A country assessment tool and user's manual, based on these principles, have been developed to support countries to assess the privacy, confidentiality, and security of personal health information at facility, data warehouse/repository, and national levels. The successful development and implementation of national guidance will require strong collaboration at local, regional, and national levels, and this is a pre-condition for the successful implementation of a range of national and global programs. CONCLUSION: This paper is a call for action for stakeholders in low- and middle-income countries to develop and implement such coherent policies and provides fundamental principles governing the areas of privacy, confidentiality, and security of personal health information being collected in low- and middle-income countries.},

  abstract = {Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias--variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias--variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This ``double-descent'' curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias--variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.},

This behavior parallels some key patterns observed in large models, including modern neural networks, and is contrasted with that of ``prescient'' models that select features in an a priori optimal order.},

  abstract = {Generalization performance of classifiers in deep learning has recently become a subject of intense study. Deep models, typically over-parametrized, tend to fit the training data exactly. Despite this "overfitting", they perform well on test data, a phenomenon not yet fully understood. The first point of our paper is that strong performance of overfitted classifiers is not a unique feature of deep learning. Using six real-world and two synthetic datasets, we establish experimentally that kernel machines trained to have zero classification or near zero regression error perform very well on test data, even when the labels are corrupted with a high level of noise. We proceed to give a lower bound on the norm of zero loss solutions for smooth kernels, showing that they increase nearly exponentially with data size. We point out that this is difficult to reconcile with the existing generalization bounds. Moreover, none of the bounds produce non-trivial results for interpolating solutions. Second, we show experimentally that (non-smooth) Laplacian kernels easily fit random labels, a finding that parallels results for ReLU neural networks. In contrast, fitting noisy data requires many more epochs for smooth Gaussian kernels. Similar performance of overfitted Laplacian and Gaussian classifiers on test, suggests that generalization is tied to the properties of the kernel function rather than the optimization process. Certain key phenomena of deep learning are manifested similarly in kernel methods in the modern "overfitted" regime. The combination of the experimental and theoretical results presented in this paper indicates a need for new theoretical ideas for understanding properties of classical kernel methods. We argue that progress on understanding deep learning will be difficult until more tractable "shallow" kernel methods are better understood.},

  abstract = {We propose a pivotal method for estimating high-dimensional sparse linear regression models, where the overall number of regressors \$p\$ is large, possibly much larger than \$n\$, but only \$s\$ regressors are significant. The method is a modification of the lasso, called the square-root lasso. The method is pivotal in that it neither relies on the knowledge of the standard deviation \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ or nor does it need to pre-estimate \${\textbackslash}sigma\$. Moreover, the method does not rely on normality or sub-Gaussianity of noise. It achieves near-oracle performance, attaining the convergence rate \${\textbackslash}sigma {\textbackslash}\{(s/n){\textbackslash}log p{\textbackslash}\}{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}\$ in the prediction norm, and thus matching the performance of the lasso with known \${\textbackslash}sigma\$. These performance results are valid for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian errors, under some mild moment restrictions. We formulate the square-root lasso as a solution to a convex conic programming problem, which allows us to implement the estimator using efficient algorithmic methods, such as interior-point and first-order methods.},

  abstract = {Attention based Transformer architecture has enabled significant advances in the field of natural language processing. In addition to new pre-training techniques, recent improvements crucially rely on working with a relatively larger embedding dimension for tokens. Unfortunately, this leads to models that are prohibitively large to be employed in the downstream tasks. In this paper we identify one of the important factors contributing to the large embedding size requirement. In particular, our analysis highlights that the scaling between the number of heads and the size of each head in the current architecture gives rise to a low-rank bottleneck in attention heads, causing this limitation. We further validate this in our experiments. As a solution we propose to set the head size of an attention unit to input sequence length, and independent of the number of heads, resulting in multi-head attention layers with provably more expressive power. We empirically show that this allows us to train models with a relatively smaller embedding dimension and with better performance scaling.},

  abstract = {Learning-based pattern classifiers, including deep networks, have shown impressive performance in several application domains, ranging from computer vision to cybersecurity. However, it has also been shown that adversarial input perturbations carefully crafted either at training or at test time can easily subvert their predictions. The vulnerability of machine learning to such wild patterns (also referred to as adversarial examples), along with the design of suitable countermeasures, have been investigated in the research field of adversarial machine learning. In this work, we provide a thorough overview of the evolution of this research area over the last ten years and beyond, starting from pioneering, earlier work on the security of non-deep learning algorithms up to more recent work aimed to understand the security properties of deep learning algorithms, in the context of computer vision and cybersecurity tasks. We report interesting connections between these apparently-different lines of work, highlighting common misconceptions related to the security evaluation of machine-learning algorithms. We review the main threat models and attacks defined to this end, and discuss the main limitations of current work, along with the corresponding future challenges towards the design of more secure learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {In modern computer vision tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are indispensable for image classification tasks due to their efficiency and effectiveness. Part of their superiority compared to other architectures, comes from the fact that a single, local filter is shared across the entire image. However, there are scenarios where we may need to treat spatial locations in non-uniform manner. We see this in nature when considering how humans have evolved foveation to process different areas in their field of vision with varying levels of detail. In this paper we propose a way to enable CNNs to learn different pooling weights for each pixel location. We do so by introducing an extended definition of a pooling operator. This operator can learn a strict super-set of what can be learned by average pooling or convolutions. It has the benefit of being shared across feature maps and can be encouraged to be local or diffuse depending on the data. We show that for fixed network weights, our pooling operator can be computed in closed-form by spectral decomposition of matrices associated with class separability. Through experiments, we show that this operator benefits generalization for ResNets and CNNs on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets and improves robustness to geometric corruptions and perturbations on the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-10-P test sets.},

Median and interquartile of age for the recordings were 58 (46-69) and 38\% of the patients were males. Recordings were assigned to train-validation and test sets in an 80:20\% split which was stratified by class, age and gender. A random forest classifier was trained to predict, for a given recording, the risk of AF development within 5-years. We use features obtained from different modalities, namely demographics, clinical information, engineered features, and features from deep representation learning.The best model performance on the test set was obtained for the model combining features from all modalities with an AUROC=0.909 against the best single modality model which had an AUROC=0.839.Our study has important clinical implications for AF management. It is the first study integrating feature engineering, deep learning and EMR metadata to create a risk prediction tool for the management of patients at risk of AF. The best model that includes features from all modalities demonstrates that human knowledge in electrophysiology combined with deep learning outperforms any single modality approach. The high performance obtained suggest that structural changes in the 12-lead ECG are associated with existing or impending AF.},

Its tendency to improve accuracy and speed up training have established BN as a favorite technique in deep learning. Yet, despite its enormous success, there remains little consensus on the exact reason and mechanism behind these improvements. In this paper we take a step towards a better understanding of BN, following an empirical approach. We conduct several experiments, and show that BN primarily enables training with larger learning rates, which is the cause for faster convergence and better generalization. For networks without BN we demonstrate how large gradient updates can result in diverging loss and activations growing uncontrollably with network depth, which limits possible learning rates. BN avoids this problem by constantly correcting activations to be zero-mean and of unit standard deviation, which enables larger gradient steps, yields faster convergence and may help bypass sharp local minima. We further show various ways in which gradients and activations of deep unnormalized networks are ill-behaved. We contrast our results against recent findings in random matrix theory, shedding new light on classical initialization schemes and their consequences.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

The second part of the paper analyzes an inexact Newton method that solves linear systems approximately using the conjugate gradient (CG) method, and that samples the Hessian and not the gradient (the gradient is assumed to be exact). We provide a complexity analysis for this method based on the properties of the CG iteration and the quality of the Hessian approximation, and compare it with a method that employs a stochastic gradient iteration instead of the CG method.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It is well known that accurate interpretation of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) requires a high degree of skill. There is also a moderate degree of variability among those who interpret the ECG. While this is the case, there are no best practice guidelines for the actual ECG interpretation process. Hence, this study adopts computerized eye tracking technology to investigate whether eye-gaze can be used to gain a deeper insight into how expert annotators interpret the ECG. Annotators were recruited in San Jose, California at the 2013 International Society of Computerised Electrocardiology (ISCE). METHODS: Each annotator was recruited to interpret a number of 12-lead ECGs (N=12) while their eye gaze was recorded using a Tobii X60 eye tracker. The device is based on corneal reflection and is non-intrusive. With a sampling rate of 60Hz, eye gaze coordinates were acquired every 16.7ms. Fixations were determined using a predefined computerized classification algorithm, which was then used to generate heat maps of where the annotators looked. The ECGs used in this study form four groups (3=ST elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], 3=hypertrophy, 3=arrhythmias and 3=exhibiting unique artefacts). There was also an equal distribution of difficulty levels (3=easy to interpret, 3=average and 3=difficult). ECGs were displayed using the 4x3+1 display format and computerized annotations were concealed. RESULTS: Precisely 252 expert ECG interpretations (21 annotators{\texttimes}12 ECGs) were recorded. Average duration for ECG interpretation was 58s (SD=23). Fleiss' generalized kappa coefficient (Pa=0.56) indicated a moderate inter-rater reliability among the annotators. There was a 79\% inter-rater agreement for STEMI cases, 71\% agreement for arrhythmia cases, 65\% for the lead misplacement and dextrocardia cases and only 37\% agreement for the hypertrophy cases. In analyzing the total fixation duration, it was found that on average annotators study lead V1 the most (4.29s), followed by leads V2 (3.83s), the rhythm strip (3.47s), II (2.74s), V3 (2.63s), I (2.53s), aVL (2.45s), V5 (2.27s), aVF (1.74s), aVR (1.63s), V6 (1.39s), III (1.32s) and V4 (1.19s). It was also found that on average the annotator spends an equal amount of time studying leads in the frontal plane (15.89s) when compared to leads in the transverse plane (15.70s). It was found that on average the annotators fixated on lead I first followed by leads V2, aVL, V1, II, aVR, V3, rhythm strip, III, aVF, V5, V4 and V6. We found a strong correlation (r=0.67) between time to first fixation on a lead and the total fixation duration on each lead. This indicates that leads studied first are studied the longest. There was a weak negative correlation between duration and accuracy (r=-0.2) and a strong correlation between age and accuracy (r=0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Eye tracking facilitated a deeper insight into how expert annotators interpret the 12-lead ECG. As a result, the authors recommend ECG annotators to adopt an initial first impression/pattern recognition approach followed by a conventional systematic protocol to ECG interpretation. This recommendation is based on observing misdiagnoses given due to first impression only. In summary, this research presents eye gaze results from expert ECG annotators and provides scope for future work that involves exploiting computerized eye tracking technology to further the science of ECG interpretation.},

The first is that any time-invariant (TI) continuous nonlinear operator can be approximated by a Volterra series operator, and the second is that the approximating operator can be realized as a finite-dimensional linear dynamical system with a nonlinear readout map. While previous approximation results are valid over finite time intervals and for signals in compact sets, the approximations presented here hold for all time and for signals in useful (noncompact) sets. The discretetime analog of the second theorem asserts that any TI operator with fading memory can be approximated (in our strong sense) by a nonlinear moving- average operator. Some further discussion of the notion of fading memory is given.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Endothelial dysfunction is associated to cardiovascular risk factors and predicts cardiovascular events. Peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) is a novel noninvasive method to assess endothelial function. However, there is a paucity of data about its reproducibility. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and reproducibility of PAT in adults. Methods: PAT exams were performed twice in the same day in 123 participants of a cohort about the determinants of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health -- ELSA-Brasil). The interval between the exams was 2--6 h (mean {$\frac{1}{4}$} 4 h). Endothelial function in PAT method is measured by reactive hyperemia index (RHI), which evaluates arterial pulsatile volume changes in response to hyperemia. Agreement of RHI values was compared by Bland--Altman method, coefficient of variation and coefficient of repeatability. Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: Mean values of RHI did not differ significantly between the exams of each participant (1.92 {\AE} 0.56 vs. 1.96 {\AE} 0.58, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.48). There were no systematic errors between the exams (mean of differences {$\frac{1}{4}$} {\`A}0.03 {\AE} 0.5). Measurement error was 0.35, coefficient of variation was 18.0\% and ICC was 0.61. Sex, age or the presence of obesity did not have a considerable influence on the reproducibility of PAT. Conclusion: PAT exam is feasible and has acceptable reproducibility in adults when compared with other noninvasive methods for endothelial function assessment. This performance makes PAT a promising method for future clinical and epidemiological studies.},

The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

Our presentation of black-box optimization, strongly influenced by Nesterov's seminal book and Nemirovski's lecture notes, includes the analysis of cutting plane methods, as well as (accelerated) gradient descent schemes. We also pay special attention to non-Euclidean settings (relevant algorithms include Frank-Wolfe, mirror descent, and dual averaging) and discuss their relevance in machine learning. We provide a gentle introduction to structural optimization with FISTA (to optimize a sum of a smooth and a simple non-smooth term), saddle-point mirror prox (Nemirovski's alternative to Nesterov's smoothing), and a concise description of interior point methods. In stochastic optimization we discuss stochastic gradient descent, mini-batches, random coordinate descent, and sublinear algorithms. We also briefly touch upon convex relaxation of combinatorial problems and the use of randomness to round solutions, as well as random walks based methods.},

In particular, this conjecture implies that overparametrization is necessary for robustness, since it means that one needs roughly one neuron per datapoint to ensure a \$O(1)\$-Lipschitz network, while mere data fitting of \$d\$-dimensional data requires only one neuron per \$d\$ datapoints. We prove a weaker version of this conjecture when the Lipschitz constant is replaced by an upper bound on it based on the spectral norm of the weight matrix. We also prove the conjecture in the high-dimensional regime \$n {\textbackslash}approx d\$ (which we also refer to as the undercomplete case, since only \$k {\textbackslash}leq d\$ is relevant here). Finally we prove the conjecture for polynomial activation functions of degree \$p\$ when \$n {\textbackslash}approx d{\textasciicircum}p\$. We complement these findings with experimental evidence supporting the conjecture.},

A puzzling phenomenon in deep learning is that models are trained with many more parameters than what this classical theory would suggest. We propose a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. We prove that for a broad class of data distributions and model classes, overparametrization is necessary if one wants to interpolate the data smoothly. Namely we show that smooth interpolation requires \$d\$ times more parameters than mere interpolation, where \$d\$ is the ambient data dimension. We prove this universal law of robustness for any smoothly parametrized function class with polynomial size weights, and any covariate distribution verifying isoperimetry. In the case of two-layers neural networks and Gaussian covariates, this law was conjectured in prior work by Bubeck, Li and Nagaraj. We also give an interpretation of our result as an improved generalization bound for model classes consisting of smooth functions.},

Class imbalance is a common problem that has been comprehensively studied in classical machine learning, yet very limited systematic research is available in the context of deep learning. In our study, we use three benchmark datasets of increasing complexity, MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, to investigate the effects of imbalance on classification and perform an extensive comparison of several methods to address the issue: oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding that compensates for prior class probabilities. Our main evaluation metric is area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) adjusted to multi-class tasks since overall accuracy metric is associated with notable difficulties in the context of imbalanced data. Based on results from our experiments we conclude that (i) the effect of class imbalance on classification performance is detrimental; (ii) the method of addressing class imbalance that emerged as dominant in almost all analyzed scenarios was oversampling; (iii) oversampling should be applied to the level that completely eliminates the imbalance, whereas the optimal undersampling ratio depends on the extent of imbalance; (iv) as opposed to some classical machine learning models, oversampling does not cause overfitting of CNNs; (v) thresholding should be applied to compensate for prior class probabilities when overall number of properly classified cases is of interest.},

  abstract = {Posynomials are nonnegative combinations of monomials with possibly fractional and both positive and negative exponents. Posynomial models are widely used in various engineering design endeavors, such as circuits, aerospace and structural design, mainly due to the fact that design problems cast in terms of posynomial objectives and constraints can be solved efficiently by means of a convex optimization technique known as geometric programming (GP). However, while quite a vast literature exists on GP-based design, very few contributions can yet be found on the problem of identifying posynomial models from experimental data. Posynomial identification amounts to determining not only the coefficients of the combination, but also the exponents in the monomials, which renders the identification problem hard. In this paper, we propose an approach to the identification of multivariate posynomial models based on the expansion on a given large-scale basis of monomials. The model is then identified by seeking coefficients of the combination that minimize a mixed objective, composed by a term representing the fitting error and a term inducing sparsity in the representation, which results in a problem formulation of the ``square-root LASSO'' type, with nonnegativity constraints on the variables. We propose to solve the problem via a sequential coordinate-minimization scheme, which is suitable for large-scale implementations. A numerical example is finally presented, dealing with the identification of a posynomial model for a NACA 4412 airfoil.},

In this paper, we develop an inferential method based on ideas from conformal prediction, which can wrap around any survival prediction algorithm to produce calibrated, covariate-dependent lower predictive bounds on survival times. In the Type I right-censoring setting, when the censoring times are completely exogenous, the lower predictive bounds have guaranteed coverage in finite samples without any assumptions other than that of operating on independent and identically distributed data points. Under a more general conditionally independent censoring assumption, the bounds satisfy a doubly robust property which states the following: marginal coverage is approximately guaranteed if either the censoring mechanism or the conditional survival function is estimated well. Further, we demonstrate that the lower predictive bounds remain valid and informative for other types of censoring. The validity and efficiency of our procedure are demonstrated on synthetic data and real COVID-19 data from the UK Biobank.},

Suppose then that we have observations y = X{$\beta$} + z, where \${\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}in \{{\textbackslash}bf R\}{\textasciicircum}\{p\}\$ is a parameter vector of interest, X is a data matrix with possibly far fewer rows than columns, n << p, and the \$z\_\{i\}{\textbackslash}text\{'\}\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}\$ are i.i.d. N(0, {$\sigma^2$}). Is it possible to estimate {$\beta$} reliably based on the noisy data y? To estimate {$\beta$}, we introduce a new estimator-we call it the Dantzig selector-which is a solution to the l{$_1$}-regularization problem \${\textbackslash}underset {\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}beta\}{\textbackslash}in \{{\textbackslash}bf R\}{\textasciicircum}\{p\}{\textbackslash}to\{\{{\textbackslash}rm min\}\}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}beta\}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\_\{{\textbackslash}ell \_\{1\}\}\$ subject to \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}X{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ast \}r{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\_\{{\textbackslash}ell \_\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\}{\textbackslash}leq (1+t{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}){\textbackslash}sqrt\{2{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm log\}{\textbackslash},p\}{\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}sigma \$, where r is the residual vector \$y-X{\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}beta\}\$ and t is a positive scalar. We show that if X obeys a uniform uncertainty principle (with unit-normed columns) and if the true parameter vector {$\beta$} is sufficiently sparse (which here roughly guarantees that the model is identifiable), then with very large probability, \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}beta\}-{\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}{\textbar}\_\{{\textbackslash}ell \_\{2\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}leq C{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}cdot 2{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm log\}{\textbackslash},p{\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}sigma {\textasciicircum}\{2\}+{\textbackslash}sum\_\{i\}\{{\textbackslash}rm min\}({\textbackslash}beta \_\{i\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\},{\textbackslash}sigma {\textasciicircum}\{2\}){\textbackslash}right)\$. Our results are nonasymptotic and we give values for the constant C. Even though n may be much smaller than p, our estimator achieves a loss within a logarithmic factor of the ideal mean squared error one would achieve with an oracle which would supply perfect information about which coordinates are nonzero, and which were above the noise level. In multivariate regression and from a model selection viewpoint, our result says that it is possible nearly to select the best subset of variables by solving a very simple convex program, which, in fact, can easily be recast as a convenient linear program (LP).},

This survey paper aims at reconstructing the history of how thresholding rules came to be popular in statistics and describing, in a not overly technical way, the domain of their application. Two notions play a fundamental role in our narrative: sparsity and oracle inequalities. Sparsity is a property of the object to estimate, which seems to be characteristic of many modern problems, in statistics as well as applied mathematics and theoretical computer science, to name a few. `Oracle inequalities' are a powerful decision-theoretic tool which has served to understand the optimality of thresholding rules, but which has many other potential applications, some of which we will discuss.             Our story is also the story of the dialogue between statistics and applied harmonic analysis. Starting with the work of Wiener, we will see that certain representations emerge as being optimal for estimation. A leitmotif throughout our exposition is that efficient representations lead to efficient estimation.},

Cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation, are a major global healthcare challenge. Treatment is often through catheter ablation, which involves the targeted localized destruction of regions of the myocardium responsible for initiating or perpetuating the arrhythmia. Ablation targets are either anatomically defined, or identified based on their functional properties as determined through the analysis of contact intracardiac electrograms acquired with increasing spatial density by modern electroanatomic mapping systems. While numerous quantitative approaches have been investigated over the past decades for identifying these critical curative sites, few have provided a reliable and reproducible advance in success rates. Machine learning techniques, including recent deep-learning approaches, offer a potential route to gaining new insight from this wealth of highly complex spatio-temporal information that existing methods struggle to analyse. Coupled with predictive modelling, these techniques offer exciting opportunities to advance the field and produce more accurate diagnoses and robust personalised treatment. We outline some of these methods and illustrate their use in making predictions from the contact electrogram and augmenting predictive modelling tools, both by more rapidly predicting future states of the system and by inferring the parameters of these models from experimental observations.},

This paper outlines the study and baseline characteristics of the participants. Participants The study is being conducted in 21 municipalities of the northern part of Minas Gerais State in Brazil, and includes a follow-up of 2 years. The baseline evaluation included collection of sociodemographic information, social determinants of health, health-related behaviours, comorbidities, medicines in use, history of previous treatment for Chagas disease, functional class, quality of life, blood sample collection, and ECG. Patients were mostly female, aged 50--74 years, with low family income and educational level, with known Chagas disease for {$>$}10 years; 46\% presented with functional class {$>$}II. Previous use of benznidazole was reported by 25.2\% and permanent use of pacemaker by 6.2\%. Almost half of the patients presented with high blood cholesterol and hypertension, and one-third of them had diabetes mellitus. N-terminal of the prohormone BNP (NT-ProBNP) level was {$>$}300 pg/mL in 30\% of the sample. Findings to date Clinical and laboratory markers predictive of severe and progressive Chagas disease were identified as high NT-ProBNP levels, as well as symptoms of advanced heart failure. These results confirm the important residual morbidity of Chagas disease in the remote areas, thus supporting political decisions that should prioritise in addition to epidemiological surveillance the medical treatment of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy in the coming years. The S{\~a}o Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical Medicine Research Center (SaMi-Trop) represents a major challenge for focused research in neglected diseases, with knowledge that can be applied in primary healthcare. Future plans We will continue following this patients' cohort to provide relevant information about the development and progression of Chagas disease in remotes areas, with social and economic inequalities.

  abstract = {In this paper we show how to achieve state-of-the-art certified adversarial robustness to 2-norm bounded perturbations by relying exclusively on off-the-shelf pretrained models. To do so, we instantiate the denoised smoothing approach of Salman et al. 2020 by combining a pretrained denoising diffusion probabilistic model and a standard high-accuracy classifier. This allows us to certify 71\% accuracy on ImageNet under adversarial perturbations constrained to be within an 2-norm of 0.5, an improvement of 14 percentage points over the prior certified SoTA using any approach, or an improvement of 30 percentage points over denoised smoothing. We obtain these results using only pretrained diffusion models and image classifiers, without requiring any fine tuning or retraining of model parameters.},

In this paper, we investigate their application in the context of nonparametric statistical learning. More precisely, we study the estimator defined by stochastic gradient with mini batches and random features. The latter can be seen as form of nonlinear sketching and used to define approximate kernel methods. The considered estimator is not explicitly penalized/constrained and regularization is implicit. Indeed, our study highlights how different parameters, such as number of features, iterations, step-size and mini-batch size control the learning properties of the solutions. We do this by deriving optimal finite sample bounds, under standard assumptions. The obtained results are corroborated and illustrated by numerical experiments.},

Gradients can be attenuated by transition operators and are attenuated or dropped by activation functions. Canonical architectures like LSTM alleviate this issue by skipping information through a memory mechanism. We propose a new recurrent architecture (Non-saturating Recurrent Unit; NRU) that relies on a memory mechanism but forgoes both saturating activation functions and saturating gates, in order to further alleviate vanishing gradients. In a series of synthetic and real world tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed model is the only model that performs among the top 2 models across all tasks with and without long-term dependencies, when compared against a range of other architectures.},

The methods are: echo state network (a type of reservoir computing, RC-ESN), deep feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN), and recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM). This Lorenz 96 system has three tiers of nonlinearly interacting variables representing slow/large-scale (\$X\$), intermediate (\$Y\$), and fast/small-scale (\$Z\$) processes. For training or testing, only \$X\$ is available; \$Y\$ and \$Z\$ are never known or used. We show that RC-ESN substantially outperforms ANN and RNN-LSTM for short-term prediction, e.g., accurately forecasting the chaotic trajectories for hundreds of numerical solver's time steps, equivalent to several Lyapunov timescales. The RNN-LSTM and ANN show some prediction skills as well; RNN-LSTM bests ANN. Furthermore, even after losing the trajectory, data predicted by RC-ESN and RNN-LSTM have probability density functions (PDFs) that closely match the true PDF, even at the tails. The PDF of the data predicted using ANN, however, deviates from the true PDF. Implications, caveats, and applications to data-driven and data-assisted surrogate modeling of complex nonlinear dynamical systems such as weather/climate are discussed.},

We prove that SGD minimizes an average potential over the posterior distribution of weights along with an entropic regularization term. This potential is however not the original loss function in general. So SGD does perform variational inference, but for a different loss than the one used to compute the gradients. Even more surprisingly, SGD does not even converge in the classical sense: we show that the most likely trajectories of SGD for deep networks do not behave like Brownian motion around critical points. Instead, they resemble closed loops with deterministic components. We prove that such ``out-of-equilibrium'' behavior is a consequence of highly non-isotropic gradient noise in SGD; the covariance matrix of mini-batch gradients for deep networks has a rank as small as 1\% of its dimension. We provide extensive empirical validation of these claims, proven in the appendix.},

  abstract = {The time-frequency and time-scale communities have recently developed a large number of overcomplete waveform dictionaries --- stationary wavelets, wavelet packets, cosine packets, chirplets, and warplets, to name a few. Decomposition into overcomplete systems is not unique, and several methods for decomposition have been proposed, including the method of frames (MOF), Matching pursuit (MP), and, for special dictionaries, the best orthogonal basis (BOB).Basis Pursuit (BP) is a principle for decomposing a signal into an "optimal" superposition of dictionary elements, where optimal means having the smallest l1 norm of coefficients among all such decompositions. We give examples exhibiting several advantages over MOF, MP, and BOB, including better sparsity and superresolution. BP has interesting relations to ideas in areas as diverse as ill-posed problems, in abstract harmonic analysis, total variation denoising, and multiscale edge denoising.BP in highly overcomplete dictionaries leads to large-scale optimization problems. With signals of length 8192 and a wavelet packet dictionary, one gets an equivalent linear program of size 8192 by 212,992. Such problems can be attacked successfully only because of recent advances in linear programming by interior-point methods. We obtain reasonable success with a primal-dual logarithmic barrier method and conjugate-gradient solver.}

Our model, which was ranked first in the challenge competition, achieved a median overall F1-score of 0.84 for the nine-type CA classification of CPSC2018's hidden test set of 2,954 ECG recordings. Further analysis showed that concurrent CAs were adequately predictive for 476 patients with multiple types of CA diagnoses in the dataset. Using only single-lead data yielded a performance that was only slightly worse than using the full 12-lead data, with leads aVR and V1 being the most prominent.

External disturbances and approximation errors are counteracted by robust signals. The actuator controller is designed based on the backstepping scheme. Compared with the existing work, the proposed method considers the manipulator kinematics uncertainty, does not need the ``linearity-in-parameters'' assumption for the uncertain terms in the dynamics of manipulator and actuator, and guarantees the tracking error to be as small as desired.

We depart from the classical setting by allowing for {$\eta$}0 to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions, such as Donsker properties, that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate {$\eta$}0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods which are particularly well-suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating {$\eta$}0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of {\texttheta}0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of {$\eta$}0 into estimating equations for {\texttheta}0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N -1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest {\texttheta}0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate {\texttheta}0, and (2) making use of cross-fitting which provides an efficient form of data-splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in a N -1/2-neighborhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model, DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model, DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness, and DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.},

  abstract = {QRS detection performance can depend on the type of noise present in each lead involved in the overall processing. A common approach to QRS detection is based on a QRS enhanced signal obtained from the derivatives of the pre-filtered leads. However, the signal pre-filtering cannot be able to perform a complete noise rejection and the use of derivatives can enhance the noise as well. In many cases the noise occurs only on one lead and the addition of a noisy lead to the QRS enhanced signal decreases the overall detection performances of the QRS detector. For this reason the noise estimation on each channel, providing information for the channel inclusion or rejection in building the QRS enhanced signal, can improve the overall performances of the QRS detector. The results have been evaluated on the 48 records of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database where each ECG record is composed by 2 leads sampled at 360 Hz for a total duration of about 30 minutes. The annotated QRSs are 109494 in total. The results have been very satisfying on all the annotated QRSs and, with the inclusion of an automatic criterion for ventricular flutter detection, a sensitivity=99.76\% and a positive predictive value=99.81\% have been obtained.},

In previous work, we have shown that such architectures are comparable to state-of-theart ASR systems on dictation tasks, but it was not clear if such architectures would be practical for more challenging tasks such as voice search. In this work, we explore a variety of structural and optimization improvements to our LAS model which significantly improve performance. On the structural side, we show that word piece models can be used instead of graphemes. We also introduce a multi-head attention architecture, which offers improvements over the commonly-used single-head attention. On the optimization side, we explore synchronous training, scheduled sampling, label smoothing, and minimum word error rate optimization, which are all shown to improve accuracy. We present results with a unidirectional LSTM encoder for streaming recognition. On a 12, 500 hour voice search task, we find that the proposed changes improve the WER from 9.2\% to 5.6\%, while the best conventional system achieves 6.7\%; on a dictation task our model achieves a WER of 4.1\% compared to 5\% for the conventional system.},

In this work, we show that this "lazy training" phenomenon is not specific to over-parameterized neural networks, and is due to a choice of scaling, often implicit, that makes the model behave as its linearization around the initialization, thus yielding a model equivalent to learning with positive-definite kernels. Through a theoretical analysis, we exhibit various situations where this phenomenon arises in non-convex optimization and we provide bounds on the distance between the lazy and linearized optimization paths. Our numerical experiments bring a critical note, as we observe that the performance of commonly used non-linear deep convolutional neural networks in computer vision degrades when trained in the lazy regime. This makes it unlikely that "lazy training" is behind the many successes of neural networks in difficult high dimensional tasks.},

In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.},

While present PRSs typically explain only a small fraction of trait variance, their correlation with the single largest contributor to phenotypic variation---genetic liability---has led to the routine application of PRSs across biomedical research. Among a range of applications, PRSs are exploited to assess shared etiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the clinical utility of genetic data for complex disease and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed that compare outcomes (e.g., gene expression and cellular response to treatment) between individuals with low and high PRS values. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRSs become more powerful, PRSs are set to play a key role in research and stratified medicine. However, despite the importance and growing application of PRSs, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here, we provide detailed guidelines for performing and interpreting PRS analyses. We outline standard quality control steps, discuss different methods for the calculation of PRSs, provide an introductory online tutorial, highlight common misconceptions relating to PRS results, offer recommendations for best practice and discuss future challenges.},

Our comparison to state-of-the-art model-based and model-free deep RL algorithms shows that our approach matches the asymptotic performance of model-free algorithms on several challenging benchmark tasks, while requiring significantly fewer samples (e.g., 8 and 125 times fewer samples than Soft Actor Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization respectively on the half-cheetah task).},

Most recent analysis has focused on model outputs (e.g., language model surprisal) or internal vector representations (e.g., probing classifiers). Complementary to these works, we propose methods for analyzing the attention mechanisms of pre-trained models and apply them to BERT. BERT's attention heads exhibit patterns such as attending to delimiter tokens, specific positional offsets, or broadly attending over the whole sentence, with heads in the same layer often exhibiting similar behaviors. We further show that certain attention heads correspond well to linguistic notions of syntax and coreference. For example, we find heads that attend to the direct objects of verbs, determiners of nouns, objects of prepositions, and coreferent mentions with remarkably high accuracy. Lastly, we propose an attention-based probing classifier and use it to further demonstrate that substantial syntactic information is captured in BERT's attention.},

This was conjectured by Bernard0 (1979) and, despite the absence of a proof, forms the basis of the reference prior method in Bayesian statistical analysis. Our proof rests on an examination of large sample decision theoretic properties associated with the relative entropy or the Kullback-Leibler distance between probability density functions for independent and identically distributed random variables. For smooth finite-dimensional parametric families we derive an asymptotic expression for the minimax risk and for the related maximin risk. As a result, we show that, among continuous positive priors, Jeffreys' prior uniquely achieves the asymptotic maximin value. In the discrete parameter case we show that, asymptotically, the Bayes risk reduces to the entropy of the prior so that the reference prior is seen to be the maximum entropy prior. We identify the physical significance of the risks by giving two information-theoretic interpretations in terms of probabilistic coding.},

We use randomized smoothing to obtain an ImageNet classifier with e.g. a certified top-1 accuracy of 49\% under adversarial perturbations with \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$ norm less than 0.5 (=127/255). No certified defense has been shown feasible on ImageNet except for smoothing. On smaller-scale datasets where competing approaches to certified \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$ robustness are viable, smoothing delivers higher certified accuracies. Our strong empirical results suggest that randomized smoothing is a promising direction for future research into adversarially robust classification.

We derive such constants in the context of a general layered network model involving compositions of nonexpansive averaged operators and affine operators. By exploiting this architecture, our analysis finely captures the interactions between the layers, yielding tighter Lipschitz constants than those resulting from the product of individual bounds for groups of layers. The proposed framework is shown to cover in particular many practical instances encountered in feed-forward neural networks. Our Lipschitz constant estimates are further improved in the case of structures employing scalar nonlinear functions, which include standard convolutional networks as special cases.},

These bounds help determine the degree of approximation that can be tolerated in the estimation of the kernel matrix.

  abstract = {As a research community, we are still lacking a systematic understanding of the progress on adversarial robustness which often makes it hard to identify the most promising ideas in training robust models. A key challenge in benchmarking robustness is that its evaluation is often error-prone leading to robustness overestimation. Our goal is to establish a standardized benchmark of adversarial robustness, which as accurately as possible reflects the robustness of the considered models within a reasonable computational budget. To this end, we start by considering the image classification task and introduce restrictions (possibly loosened in the future) on the allowed models. We evaluate adversarial robustness with AutoAttack, an ensemble of white- and black-box attacks, which was recently shown in a large-scale study to improve almost all robustness evaluations compared to the original publications. To prevent overadaptation of new defenses to AutoAttack, we welcome external evaluations based on adaptive attacks, especially where AutoAttack flags a potential overestimation of robustness. Our leaderboard, hosted at https://robustbench.github.io/, contains evaluations of 120+ models and aims at reflecting the current state of the art in image classification on a set of well-defined tasks in \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty\$- and \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$-threat models and on common corruptions, with possible extensions in the future. Additionally, we open-source the library https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench that provides unified access to 80+ robust models to facilitate their downstream applications. Finally, based on the collected models, we analyze the impact of robustness on the performance on distribution shifts, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, fairness, privacy leakage, smoothness, and transferability.},

  abstract = {Neural Network for Detecting AF. Introduction: A neural network classifier has been designed, which is able to distinguish atrial fibrillation (AF) from other supraventricular arrhythmias in ambulatory (Holter) ECGs. Method and Results: The classification algorithm uses a rhythm analysts that considers the ECG to be a time series of RR interval durations. This is combined with an analysis of baseline morphology that considers the morphological characteristics of the non-QRS portions of the waveform. A back propagation-based neural network has been used as part of the classifier implementation. When applied to a library consisting exclusively of 42,970 examples of AF and other supraventricular rhythm disturbances validated by an experienced cardiologist, the algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity of 82.4\% for 10-beat runs of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and a specificity of 96.6\%. Since this system has been implemented as a postprocessor to a conventional automated Holter system, operating only on segments of ECG that are known to contain supraventricular arrhythmias rather than ventricular arrhythmias or sinus rhythm, it can be added to most existing Holter processing systems without significantly increasing the average time to process a tape. Conclusion: A neural network system has been designed, which can potentially provide, for the first time, an accurate, quantitative technique to determine the natural history of PAF and to evaluate potential treatments for PAF.},

  abstract = {Conventional statistical wisdom established a well-understood relationship between model complexity and prediction error, typically presented as a \_U-shaped curve\_ reflecting a transition between under- and overfitting regimes. However, motivated by the success of overparametrized neural networks, recent influential work has suggested this theory to be generally incomplete, introducing an additional regime that exhibits a second descent in test error as the parameter count \$p\$ grows past sample size \$n\$ -- a phenomenon dubbed \_double descent\_. While most attention has naturally been given to the deep-learning setting, double descent was shown to emerge more generally across non-neural models: known cases include \_linear regression, trees, and boosting\_. In this work, we take a closer look at the evidence surrounding these more classical statistical machine learning methods and challenge the claim that observed cases of double descent truly extend the limits of a traditional U-shaped complexity-generalization curve therein. We show that once careful consideration is given to \_what is being plotted\_ on the x-axes of their double descent plots, it becomes apparent that there are implicitly multiple, distinct complexity axes along which the parameter count grows. We demonstrate that the second descent appears exactly (and \_only\_) when and where the transition between these underlying axes occurs, and that its location is thus \_not\_ inherently tied to the interpolation threshold \$p=n\$. We then gain further insight by adopting a classical nonparametric statistics perspective. We interpret the investigated methods as \_smoothers\_ and propose a generalized measure for the \_effective\_ number of parameters they use \_on unseen examples\_, using which we find that their apparent double descent curves do indeed fold back into more traditional convex shapes -- providing a resolution to the ostensible tension between double descent and traditional statistical intuition.},

The first approach is to predict what comes next in a sequence, which is a conventional language model in natural language processing. The second approach is to use a sequence autoencoder, which reads the input sequence into a vector and predicts the input sequence again. These two algorithms can be used as a "pretraining" step for a later supervised sequence learning algorithm. In other words, the parameters obtained from the unsupervised step can be used as a starting point for other supervised training models. In our experiments, we find that long short term memory recurrent networks after being pretrained with the two approaches are more stable and generalize better. With pretraining, we are able to train long short term memory recurrent networks up to a few hundred timesteps, thereby achieving strong performance in many text classification tasks, such as IMDB, DBpedia and 20 Newsgroups.},

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80\% longer than RNNs and 450\% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens.

However, in many domains, including spam detection, intrusion detection, fraud detection, surveillance and counter-terrorism, this is far from the case: the data is actively manipulated by an adversary seeking to make the classifier produce false negatives. In these domains, the performance of a classifier can degrade rapidly after it is deployed, as the adversary learns to defeat it. Currently the only solution to this is repeated, manual, ad hoc reconstruction of the classifier. In this paper we develop a formal framework and algorithms for this problem. We view classification as a game between the classifier and the adversary, and produce a classifier that is optimal given the adversary's optimal strategy. Experiments in a spam detection domain show that this approach can greatly outperform a classifier learned in the standard way, and (within the parameters of the problem) automatically adapt the classifier to the adversary's evolving manipulations.},

An ML pipeline is underspecified when it can return many predictors with equivalently strong held-out performance in the training domain. Underspecification is common in modern ML pipelines, such as those based on deep learning. Predictors returned by underspecified pipelines are often treated as equivalent based on their training domain performance, but we show here that such predictors can behave very differently in deployment domains. This ambiguity can lead to instability and poor model behavior in practice, and is a distinct failure mode from previously identified issues arising from structural mismatch between training and deployment domains. We show that this problem appears in a wide variety of practical ML pipelines, using examples from computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, clinical risk prediction based on electronic health records, and medical genomics. Our results show the need to explicitly account for underspecification in modeling pipelines that are intended for real-world deployment in any domain.},

  abstract = {Adversarial robustness has become a fundamental requirement in modern machine learning applications. Yet, there has been surprisingly little statistical understanding so far. In this paper, we provide the first result of the \emph{optimal} minimax guarantees for the excess risk for adversarially robust classification, under Gaussian mixture model proposed by schmidt2018adversarially. The results are stated in terms of the \emph{Adversarial Signal-to-Noise Ratio (AdvSNR)}, which generalizes a similar notion for standard linear classification to the adversarial setting. For the Gaussian mixtures with AdvSNR value of r, we prove an excess risk lower bound of order {$\Theta$}(e\textsuperscript{-({$\frac{1}{2}$}+o(1)) r{$^{2}$}} \textsuperscript{d}{\textfractionsolidus}\textsubscript{n}) and design a computationally efficient estimator that achieves this optimal rate. Our results built upon minimal assumptions while cover a wide spectrum of adversarial perturbations including \textsubscript{p} balls for any p 1.}

It has been recognized that they may cycle, and there is no good understanding of their limit points when they do not. When they converge, do they converge to local min-max solutions? We characterize the limit points of two basic first order methods, namely Gradient Descent/Ascent (GDA) and Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA). We show that both dynamics avoid unstable critical points for almost all initializations. Moreover, for small step sizes and under mild assumptions, the set of {\textbackslash}\{OGDA{\textbackslash}\}-stable critical points is a superset of {\textbackslash}\{GDA{\textbackslash}\}-stable critical points, which is a superset of local min-max solutions (strict in some cases). The connecting thread is that the behavior of these dynamics can be studied from a dynamical systems perspective.},

We focus in particular on the class of nonlinear systems which exhibit autonomous oscillations. Three type of excitation signals are considered: random-phase multisines, filtered white noise and swept sines. It is shown that depending on the excitation signal, the resulting model can fail to reproduce the autonomous output. Results are presented for the forced Van der Pol oscillator and the oscillatory wake of an submerged circular cylinder in a flow. It is moreover shown that broadband excitations such as multisines or noise, are appropriate signals when intending to capture the synchronisation principle observed for autonomous oscillators. The latter is shown on computational fluid dynamic data of a submerged cylinder in a flow.},

  abstract = {The volume and complexity of diagnostic imaging is increasing at a pace faster than the availability of human expertise to interpret it. Artificial intelligence has shown great promise in classifying two-dimensional photographs of some common diseases and typically relies on databases of millions of annotated images. Until now, the challenge of reaching the performance of expert clinicians in a real-world clinical pathway with three-dimensional diagnostic scans has remained unsolved. Here, we apply a novel deep learning architecture to a clinically heterogeneous set of three-dimensional optical coherence tomography scans from patients referred to a major eye hospital. We demonstrate performance in making a referral recommendation that reaches or exceeds that of experts on a range of sight-threatening retinal diseases after training on only 14,884 scans. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tissue segmentations produced by our architecture act as a device-independent representation; referral accuracy is maintained when using tissue segmentations from a different type of device. Our work removes previous barriers to wider clinical use without prohibitive training data requirements across multiple pathologies in a real-world setting.}

The classifier is obtained by running gradient-descent (GD) on the logistic-loss. For this model, we investigate the dependence of the classification error on the overparameterization ratio {$\kappa$} = p/n. First, building on known deterministic results on convergence properties of the GD, we uncover a phase-transition phenomenon for the case of Gaussian features: the classification error of GD is the same as that of the maximum-likelihood (ML) solution when {$\kappa$} {$<$}; {$\kappa$}*, and that of the max-margin (SVM) solution when {$\kappa$} {$>$} {$\kappa$}*. Next, using the convex Gaussian min-max theorem (CGMT), we sharply characterize the performance of both the ML and SVM solutions. Combining these results, we obtain curves that explicitly characterize the test error of GD for varying values of {$\kappa$}. The numerical results validate the theoretical predictions and unveil ``double-descent'' phenomena that complement similar recent observations in linear regression settings.},

  abstract = {Background: Reproducibility concerns the degree to which repeated measurements provide similar results. Agreement parameters assess how close the results of the repeated measurements are, by estimating the measurement error in repeated measurements. Reliability parameters assess whether study objects, often persons, can be distinguished from each other, despite measurement errors. In that case, the measurement error is related to the variability between persons. Consequently, reliability parameters are highly dependent on the heterogeneity of the study sample, while the agreement parameters, based on measurement error, are more a pure characteristic of the measurement instrument. Methods and Results: Using an example of an interrater study, in which different physical therapists measure the range of motion of the arm in patients with shoulder complaints, the differences and relationships between reliability and agreement parameters for continuous variables are illustrated. Conclusion: If the research question concerns the distinction of persons, reliability parameters are the most appropriate. But if the aim is to measure change in health status, which is often the case in clinical practice, parameters of agreement are preferred. {\'O} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

  abstract = {Supervised machine learning applications in health care are often limited due to a scarcity of labeled training data. To mitigate the effect of small sample size, we introduce a pre-training approach, Patient Contrastive Learning of Representations (PCLR), which creates latent representations of electrocardiograms (ECGs) from a large number of unlabeled examples using contrastive learning. The resulting representations are expressive, performant, and practical across a wide spectrum of clinical tasks. We develop PCLR using a large health care system with over 3.2 million 12-lead ECGs and demonstrate that training linear models on PCLR representations achieves a 51\% performance increase, on average, over six training set sizes and four tasks (sex classification, age regression, and the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation), relative to training neural network models from scratch. We also compared PCLR to three other ECG pre-training approaches (supervised pre-training, unsupervised pre-training with an autoencoder, and pre-training using a contrastive multi ECG-segment approach), and show significant performance benefits in three out of four tasks. We found an average performance benefit of 47\% over the other models and an average of a 9\% performance benefit compared to best model for each task. We release PCLR to enable others to extract ECG representations at https://github.com/ broadinstitute/ml4h/tree/master/model\_zoo/PCLR.},

R1-PCA is similar to PCA in that (1) it has a unique global solution, (2) the solution are principal eigenvectors of a robust covariance matrix (re-weighted to soften the effects of outliers), (3) the solution is rotational invariant. These properties are not shared by the L1-norm PCA. A new subspace iteration algorithm is given to compute R1-PCA efficiently. Experiments on several real-life datasets show R1-PCA can effectively handle outliers. We extend R1-norm to K-means clustering and show that L1-norm K-means leads to poor results while R1-K-means outperforms standard K-means.},

Especially in the case of regularized discriminant analysis, we find that predictive accuracy has a nuanced dependence on the eigenvalue distribution of the covariance matrix, suggesting that analyses based on the operator norm of the covariance matrix may not be sharp. Our results also uncover an exact inverse relation between the limiting predictive risk and the limiting estimation risk in high-dimensional linear models.

We derive exact and approximate Bayes-optimal robust classifiers for the important setting of two- and three-class Gaussian classification problems with arbitrary imbalance, for \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$ and \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty\$ adversaries. In contrast to classical Bayes-optimal classifiers, determining the optimal decisions here cannot be made pointwise and new theoretical approaches are needed. We develop and leverage new tools, including recent breakthroughs from probability theory on robust isoperimetry, which, to our knowledge, have not yet been used in the area. Our results reveal fundamental tradeoffs between standard and robust accuracy that grow when data is imbalanced. We also show further results, including an analysis of classification calibration for convex losses in certain models, and finite sample rates for the robust risk.},

Robustness, ambiguously used in multiple contexts including adversarial machine learning, refers here to preserving model performance under naturally-induced image corruptions or alterations. We perform a systematic review to identify, analyze, and summarize current definitions and progress towards non-adversarial robustness in deep learning for computer vision. We find this area of research has received disproportionately less attention relative to adversarial machine learning, yet a significant robustness gap exists that manifests in performance degradation similar in magnitude to adversarial conditions. Toward developing a more transparent definition of robustness, we provide a conceptual framework based on a structural causal model of the data generating process and interpret non-adversarial robustness as pertaining to a model's behavior on corrupted images corresponding to low-probability samples from the unaltered data distribution. We identify key architecture-, data augmentation-, and optimization tactics for improving neural network robustness. This robustness perspective reveals that common practices in the literature correspond to causal concepts. We offer perspectives on how future research may mind this evident and significant non-adversarial robustness gap.},

Our analysis relies on the following observation: over-parameterization and random initialization jointly restrict every weight vector to be close to its initialization for all iterations, which allows us to exploit a strong convexity-like property to show that gradient descent converges at a global linear rate to the global optimum. We believe these insights are also useful in analyzing deep models and other first order methods.},

  abstract = {This paper is devoted, in the main, to proving the asymptotic minimax character of the sample distribution function (d.f.) for estimating an unknown d.f. in FF{\textbackslash}mathscr\{F\} or FcFc{\textbackslash}mathscr\{F\}\_c (defined in Section 1) for a wide variety of weight functions. Section 1 contains definitions and a discussion of measurability considerations. Lemma 2 of Section 2 is an essential tool in our proofs and seems to be of interest per se; for example, it implies the convergence of the moment generating function of GnGnG\_n to that of GGG (definitions in (2.1)). In Section 3 the asymptotic minimax character is proved for a fundamental class of weight functions which are functions of the maximum deviation between estimating and true d.f. In Section 4 a device (of more general applicability in decision theory) is employed which yields the asymptotic minimax result for a wide class of weight functions of this character as a consequence of the results of Section 3 for weight functions of the fundamental class. In Section 5 the asymptotic minimax character is proved for a class of integrated weight functions. A more general class of weight functions for which the asymptotic minimax character holds is discussed in Section 6. This includes weight functions for which the risk function of the sample d.f. is not a constant over Fc.Fc.{\textbackslash}mathscr\{F\}\_c. Most weight functions of practical interest are included in the considerations of Sections 3 to 6. Section 6 also includes a discussion of multinomial estimation problems for which the asymptotic minimax character of the classical estimator is contained in our results. Finally, Section 7 includes a general discussion of minimization of symmetric convex or monotone functionals of symmetric random elements, with special consideration of the "tied-down" Wiener process, and with a heuristic proof of the results of Sections 3, 4, 5, and much of Section 6.},

It is often hard to find the global solution of this optimization problem because in most cases both the corresponding objective function and the search space are nonconvex. The difficulty in solving the optimization problem depends mainly on the experimental conditions, more specifically on the spectra of the input/output data collected from the system. It is therefore possible to improve the convergence of the algorithms by properly choosing the data prefilters; in this paper we show how to perform this choice. We present the application of the proposed approach to case studies where the standard algorithms tend to fail to converge to the global minimum.},

Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

Using a sample-splitting method, we show that it is possible to draw such inferences with finitesample coverage guarantees about the entire loss distribution, rather than just its mean. Importantly, the method takes into account model misspecifications of the past policy --including unmeasured confounding. The evaluation method can be used to certify the performance of a policy using observational data under a specified range of credible model assumptions.},

The best results obtained on supervised learning tasks often involve an unsupervised learning component, usually in an unsupervised pre-training phase. The main question investigated here is the following: why does unsupervised pre-training work so well? Through extensive experimentation, we explore several possible explanations discussed in the literature including its action as a regularizer (Erhan et al., 2009b) and as an aid to optimization (Bengio et al., 2007). Our results build on the work of Erhan et al. (2009b), showing that unsupervised pre-training appears to play predominantly a regularization role in subsequent supervised training. However our results in an online setting, with a virtually unlimited data stream, point to a somewhat more nuanced interpretation of the roles of optimization and regularization in the unsupervised pre-training effect.},

For the structured model the emphasis is on preserving the convexity of the estimation problem through a suitable relaxation of the original problem. To develop an empirical understanding of the implications of the different model design choices, all considered models are compared on an artificial system under a number of different experimental conditions. The obtained results are then validated on the Wiener--Hammerstein benchmark data set and the final models are presented. It is illustrated that black-box models are a suitable technique for the identification of Wiener--Hammerstein systems.

This paper proposes a method to calculate the limit of the eigenvalue distribution of block matrices if the size of the blocks tends to infinity. While it considers random matrices, it takes an operator-valued free probability approach to achieve this goal. Using this method, one derives a system of equations, which can be solved numerically to compute the desired eigenvalue distribution. The paper initially tackles the problem for square block matrices, then extends the solution to rectangular block matrices. Finally, it deals with Wishart type block matrices. For two special cases, the results of our approach are compared with results from simulations. The first scenario investigates the limit eigenvalue distribution of block Toeplitz matrices. The second scenario deals with the distribution of Wishart type block matrices for a frequency selective slow-fading channel in a MIMO system for two different cases of \$n\_R=n\_T\$ and \$n\_R=2n\_T\$. Using this method, one may calculate the capacity and the Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio in large MIMO systems.},

  abstract = {Classical prediction error minimization (PEM) methods are widely used for model identification, but they are also known to provide satisfactory results only in specific identification conditions, e.g. disturbance model matching. If these conditions are not met, the obtained model may have quite different dynamical behavior compared with the original system, resulting in poor long range prediction or simulation performance, which is a critical factor for model analysis, simulation, model-based control design. In the mentioned non-ideal conditions a robust and reliable alternative is based on the minimization of the simulation error. Unfortunately, direct optimization of a simulation error minimization (SEM) criterion is an intrinsically complex and computationally intensive task. In this paper a low-complexity approximate SEM approach is discussed, based on the iteration of multi-step PEM methods. The soundness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by showing that, for sufficiently high prediction horizons, the k-steps ahead (single- or multi-step) PEM criteria converge to the SEM one. Identifiability issues and convergence properties of the algorithm are also discussed. Some examples are provided to illustrate the mentioned properties of the algorithm.

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to analyze the intriguing instability of classifiers to adversarial perturbations (Szegedy et al., in: International conference on learning representations (ICLR), 2014). We provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the robustness of classifiers to adversarial perturbations, and show fundamental upper bounds on the robustness of classifiers. Specifically, we establish a general upper bound on the robustness of classifiers to adversarial perturbations, and then illustrate the obtained upper bound on two practical classes of classifiers, namely the linear and quadratic classifiers. In both cases, our upper bound depends on a distinguishability measure that captures the notion of difficulty of the classification task. Our results for both classes imply that in tasks involving small distinguishability, no classifier in the considered set will be robust to adversarial perturbations, even if a good accuracy is achieved. Our theoretical framework moreover suggests that the phenomenon of adversarial instability is due to the low flexibility of classifiers, compared to the difficulty of the classification task (captured mathematically by the distinguishability measure). We further show the existence of a clear distinction between the robustness of a classifier to random noise and its robustness to adversarial perturbations. Specifically, the former is shown to be larger than the latter by a factor that is proportional to \$\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{d\}\$\$(with d being the signal dimension) for linear classifiers. This result gives a theoretical explanation for the discrepancy between the two robustness properties in high dimensional problems, which was empirically observed by Szegedy et al. in the context of neural networks. We finally show experimental results on controlled and real-world data that confirm the theoretical analysis and extend its spirit to more complex classification schemes.},

  abstract = {Tight estimation of the Lipschitz constant for deep neural networks (DNNs) is useful in many applications ranging from robustness certification of classifiers to stability analysis of closed-loop systems with reinforcement learning controllers. Existing methods in the literature for estimating the Lipschitz constant suffer from either lack of accuracy or poor scalability. In this paper, we present a convex optimization framework to compute guaranteed upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of DNNs both accurately and efficiently. Our main idea is to interpret activation functions as gradients of convex potential functions. Hence, they satisfy certain properties that can be described by quadratic constraints. This particular description allows us to pose the Lipschitz constant estimation problem as a semidefinite program (SDP). The resulting SDP can be adapted to increase either the estimation accuracy (by capturing the interaction between activation functions of different layers) or scalability (by decomposition and parallel implementation). We illustrate the utility of our approach with a variety of experiments on randomly generated networks and on classifiers trained on the MNIST and Iris datasets. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate that our Lipschitz bounds are the most accurate compared to those in the literature. We also study the impact of adversarial training methods on the Lipschitz bounds of the resulting classifiers and show that our bounds can be used to efficiently provide robustness guarantees.},

  abstract = {Deep ensembles have been empirically shown to be a promising approach for improving accuracy, uncertainty and out-of-distribution robustness of deep learning models. While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable variational Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight space. Developing the concept of the diversity--accuracy plane, we show that the decorrelation power of random initializations is unmatched by popular subspace sampling methods. Finally, we evaluate the relative effects of ensembling, subspace based methods and ensembles of subspace based methods, and the experimental results validate our hypothesis.},

We use instability to study "iterative magnitude pruning" (IMP), the procedure used by work on the lottery ticket hypothesis to identify subnetworks that could have trained to full accuracy from initialization. We find that these subnetworks only reach full accuracy when they are stable, which either occurs at initialization for small-scale settings (MNIST) or early in training for large-scale settings (Resnet-50 and Inception-v3 on ImageNet).

However, contemporary experience is that it is difficult to train small architectures from scratch, which would similarly improve training performance. We articulate a new conjecture to explain why it is easier to train large networks: the "lottery ticket hypothesis." It states that large networks that train successfully contain subnetworks that--when trained in isolation--converge in a comparable number of iterations to comparable accuracy. These subnetworks, which we term "winning tickets," have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective. We find that a standard technique for pruning unnecessary network weights naturally uncovers a subnetwork which, at the start of training, comprised a winning ticket. We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 20\% of the size of several fully-connected, convolutional, and residual architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Furthermore, winning tickets at moderate levels of pruning (20-50\% of the original network size) converge up to 6.7x faster than the original network and exhibit higher test accuracy.},

  abstract = {Pruning is a well-established technique for removing unnecessary structure from neural networks after training to improve the performance of inference. Several recent results have explored the possibility of pruning at initialization time to provide similar benefits during training. In particular, the "lottery ticket hypothesis" conjectures that typical neural networks contain small subnetworks that can train to similar accuracy in a commensurate number of steps. The evidence for this claim is that a procedure based on iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) reliably finds such subnetworks retroactively on small vision tasks. However, IMP fails on deeper networks, and proposed methods to prune before training or train pruned networks encounter similar scaling limitations. In this paper, we argue that these efforts have struggled on deeper networks because they have focused on pruning precisely at initialization. We modify IMP to search for subnetworks that could have been obtained by pruning early in training (0.1\% to 7\% through) rather than at iteration 0. With this change, it finds small subnetworks of deeper networks (e.g., 80\% sparsity on Resnet-50) that can complete the training process to match the accuracy of the original network on more challenging tasks (e.g., ImageNet). In situations where IMP fails at iteration 0, the accuracy benefits of delaying pruning accrue rapidly over the earliest iterations of training. To explain these behaviors, we study subnetwork "stability," finding that - as accuracy improves in this fashion - IMP subnetworks train to parameters closer to those of the full network and do so with improved consistency in the face of gradient noise. These results offer new insights into the opportunity to prune large-scale networks early in training and the behaviors underlying the lottery ticket hypothesis.},

A general approach to solve for the bridge estimator is developed. A new algorithm for the lasso ({$\gamma$} = 1) is obtained by studying the structure of the bridge estimators. The shrinkage parameter {$\gamma$} and the tuning parameter {$\lambda$} are selected via generalized cross-validation (GCV). Comparison between the bridge model ({$\gamma$} {$\geq$} 1) and several other shrinkage models, namely the ordinary least squares regression ({$\lambda$} = 0), the lasso ({$\gamma$} = 1) and ridge regression ({$\gamma$} = 2), is made through a simulation study. It is shown that the bridge regression performs well compared to the lasso and ridge regression. These methods are demonstrated through an analysis of a prostate cancer data. Some computational advantages and limitations are discussed.},

  abstract = {Spatial and spectral approaches are two major approaches for image processing tasks such as image classification and object recognition. Among many such algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved significant performance improvement in many challenging tasks. Since CNNs process images directly in the spatial domain, they are essentially spatial approaches. Given that spatial and spectral approaches are known to have different characteristics, it will be interesting to incorporate a spectral approach into CNNs. We propose a novel CNN architecture, wavelet CNNs, which combines a multiresolution analysis and CNNs into one model. Our insight is that a CNN can be viewed as a limited form of a multiresolution analysis. Based on this insight, we supplement missing parts of the multiresolution analysis via wavelet transform and integrate them as additional components in the entire architecture. Wavelet CNNs allow us to utilize spectral information which is mostly lost in conventional CNNs but useful in most image processing tasks. We evaluate the practical performance of wavelet CNNs on texture classification and image annotation. The experiments show that wavelet CNNs can achieve better accuracy in both tasks than existing models while having significantly fewer parameters than conventional CNNs.},

On the other hand, Bayesian methods, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs), exploit prior knowledge to quickly infer the shape of a new function at test time. Yet GPs are computationally expensive, and it can be hard to design appropriate priors. In this paper we propose a family of neural models, Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs), that combine the benefits of both. CNPs are inspired by the flexibility of stochastic processes such as GPs, but are structured as neural networks and trained via gradient descent. CNPs make accurate predictions after observing only a handful of training data points, yet scale to complex functions and large datasets. We demonstrate the performance and versatility of the approach on a range of canonical machine learning tasks, including regression, classification and image completion.},

GPs are probabilistic, data-efficient and flexible, however they are also computationally intensive and thus limited in their applicability. We introduce a class of neural latent variable models which we call Neural Processes (NPs), combining the best of both worlds. Like GPs, NPs define distributions over functions, are capable of rapid adaptation to new observations, and can estimate the uncertainty in their predictions. Like NNs, NPs are computationally efficient during training and evaluation but also learn to adapt their priors to data.

Our solution presents several desirable features: it preserves the stability of the original filters; is well-conditioned for low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters alike; its cost is linear in the number of samples and is not affected by the size of the filter support. Our method is general and works with any non-uniformly sampled signal and any recursive digital filter defined by a difference equation. Since our formulation directly uses the filter coefficients, it works out-of-the-box with existing methodologies for digital filter design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by filtering non-uniformly sampled signals in various image and video processing tasks including edge-preserving color filtering, noise reduction, stylization, and detail enhancement. Our formulation enables, for the first time, edge-aware evaluation of any recursive infinite impulse response digital filter (not only low-pass), producing high-quality filtering results in real time.},

The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Moreover, in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised artificial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. METHODS: We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. FINDINGS: The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72{$\cdot$}3\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 71{$\cdot$}2-73{$\cdot$}2) of deaths in 2016 with 19{$\cdot$}3\% (18{$\cdot$}5-20{$\cdot$}4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8{$\cdot$}43\% (8{$\cdot$}00-8{$\cdot$}67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16-age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1{$\cdot$}80 million deaths (95\% UI 1{$\cdot$}59 million to 1{$\cdot$}89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178\% (95\% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210\% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2{$\cdot$}89\%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1{$\cdot$}59\%) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. INTERPRETATION: The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

  abstract = {Self-supervised learning is a paradigm that extracts general features which describe the input space by artificially generating labels from the input without the need for explicit annotations. The learned features can then be used by transfer learning to boost the performance on a downstream task. Such methods have recently produced state of the art results in natural language processing and computer vision. Here, we propose a self-supervised learning method for 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). For pretraining the model we design a task to mask out subsegements of all channels of the input signals and try to predict the actual values. As the model architecture, we use a U-ResNet containing an encoder-decoder structure. We test our method by self-supervised pretraining on the CODE dataset and then transfer the learnt features by finetuning on the PTB-XL and CPSC benchmarks to evaluate the effect of our method in the classification of 12-leads ECGs. The method does provide modest improvements in performance when compared to not using pretraining. In future work we will make use of these ideas in smaller dataset, where we believe it can lead to larger performance gains.},

  abstract = {Kernel principal component analysis (kPCA) is a widely studied method to construct a low-dimensional data representation after a nonlinear transformation. The prevailing method to reconstruct the original input signal from kPCA---an important task for denoising---requires us to solve a supervised learning problem. In this paper, we present an alternative method where the reconstruction follows naturally from the compression step. We first approximate the kernel with random Fourier features. Then, we exploit the fact that the nonlinear transformation is invertible in a certain subdomain. Hence, the name invertible kernel PCA (ikPCA) . We experiment with different data modalities and show that ikPCA performs similarly to kPCA with supervised reconstruction on denoising tasks, making it a strong alternative.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has been immensely successful at a variety of tasks, ranging from classification to artificial intelligence. Learning corresponds to fitting training data, which is implemented by descending a very high-dimensional loss function. Understanding under which conditions neural networks do not get stuck in poor minima of the loss, and how the landscape of that loss evolves as depth is increased, remains a challenge. Here we predict, and test empirically, an analogy between this landscape and the energy landscape of repulsive ellipses. We argue that in fully connected deep networks a phase transition delimits the over- and underparametrized regimes where fitting can or cannot be achieved. In the vicinity of this transition, properties of the curvature of the minima of the loss (the spectrum of the Hessian) are critical. This transition shares direct similarities with the jamming transition by which particles form a disordered solid as the density is increased, which also occurs in certain classes of computational optimization and learning problems such as the perceptron. Our analysis gives a simple explanation as to why poor minima of the loss cannot be encountered in the overparametrized regime. Interestingly, we observe that the ability of fully connected networks to fit random data is independent of their depth, an independence that appears to also hold for real data. We also study a quantity {$\Delta$} which characterizes how well ({$\Delta<$}0) or badly ({$\Delta>$}0) a datum is learned. At the critical point it is power-law distributed on several decades, P+({$\Delta$}){$\sim\Delta\theta$} for {$\Delta>$}0 and P-({$\Delta$}){$\sim$}(-{$\Delta$})-{$\gamma$} for {$\Delta<$}0, with exponents that depend on the choice of activation function. This observation suggests that near the transition the loss landscape has a hierarchical structure and that the learning dynamics is prone to avalanche-like dynamics, with abrupt changes in the set of patterns that are learned.},

  abstract = {Supervised deep learning involves the training of neural networks with a large number \$N\$ of parameters. For large enough \$N\$, in the so-called over-parametrized regime, one can essentially fit the training data points. Sparsity-based arguments would suggest that the generalization error increases as \$N\$ grows past a certain threshold \$N{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$. Instead, empirical studies have shown that in the over-parametrized regime, generalization error keeps decreasing with \$N\$. We resolve this paradox through a new framework. We rely on the so-called Neural Tangent Kernel, which connects large neural nets to kernel methods, to show that the initialization causes finite-size random fluctuations \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}f\_\{N\}-{\textbackslash}bar\{f\}\_\{N\}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}sim N{\textasciicircum}\{-1/4\}\$ of the neural net output function \$f\_\{N\}\$ around its expectation \${\textbackslash}bar\{f\}\_\{N\}\$. These affect the generalization error \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_\{N\}\$ for classification: under natural assumptions, it decays to a plateau value \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ in a power-law fashion \${\textbackslash}sim N{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\}\$. This description breaks down at a so-called jamming transition \$N=N{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$. At this threshold, we argue that \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}f\_\{N\}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$ diverges. This result leads to a plausible explanation for the cusp in test error known to occur at \$N{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$. Our results are confirmed by extensive empirical observations on the MNIST and CIFAR image datasets. Our analysis finally suggests that, given a computational envelope, the smallest generalization error is obtained using several networks of intermediate sizes, just beyond \$N{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$, and averaging their outputs.},

After discussing key properties of kernels, as well as a new formula to construct kernels, we present several important classes of kernels: anisotropic stationary kernels, isotropic stationary kernels, compactly supported kernels, locally stationary kernels, nonstationary kernels, and separable nonstationary kernels. Compactly supported kernels and separable nonstationary kernels are of prime interest because they provide a computational reduction for kernel-based methods. We describe the spectral representation of the various classes of kernels and conclude with a discussion on the characterization of nonlinear maps that reduce nonstationary kernels to either stationarity or local stationarity.},

We study two popular classes of models that can be regarded as linearizations of two-layers neural networks around a random initialization: the random features model of Rahimi-Recht (RF); the neural tangent kernel model of Jacot-Gabriel-Hongler (NT). Both these approaches can also be regarded as randomized approximations of kernel ridge regression (with respect to different kernels), and enjoy universal approximation properties when the number of neurons \$N\$ diverges, for a fixed dimension \$d\$. We consider two specific regimes: the approximation-limited regime, in which \$n={\textbackslash}infty\$ while \$d\$ and \$N\$ are large but finite; and the sample size-limited regime in which \$N={\textbackslash}infty\$ while \$d\$ and \$n\$ are large but finite. In the first regime we prove that if \$d{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ell + {\textbackslash}delta\} {\textbackslash}le N{\textbackslash}le d{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ell+1-{\textbackslash}delta\}\$ for small \${\textbackslash}delta {$>$} 0\$, then {\textbackslash}RF{\textbackslash}, effectively fits a degree-\${\textbackslash}ell\$ polynomial in the raw features, and {\textbackslash}NT{\textbackslash}, fits a degree-\$({\textbackslash}ell+1)\$ polynomial. In the second regime, both RF and NT reduce to kernel methods with rotationally invariant kernels. We prove that, if the number of samples is \$d{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ell + {\textbackslash}delta\} {\textbackslash}le n {\textbackslash}le d{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ell +1-{\textbackslash}delta\}\$, then kernel methods can fit at most a a degree-\${\textbackslash}ell\$ polynomial in the raw features. This lower bound is achieved by kernel ridge regression. Optimal prediction error is achieved for vanishing ridge regularization.},

  abstract = {Bayesian methods are increasingly applied in these days in the theory and practice of statistics. Any Bayesian inference depends on a likelihood and a prior. Ideally one would like to elicit a prior from related sources of information or past data. However, in its absence, Bayesian methods need to rely on some "objective" or "default" priors, and the resulting posterior inference can still be quite valuable. Not surprisingly, over the years, the catalog of objective priors also has become prohibitively large, and one has to set some specific criteria for the selection of such priors. Our aim is to review some of these criteria, compare their performance, and illustrate them with some simple examples. While for very large sample sizes, it does not possibly matter what objective prior one uses, the selection of such a prior does influence inference for small or moderate samples. For regular models where asymptotic normality holds, Jeffreys' general rule prior, the positive square root of the determinant of the Fisher information matrix, enjoys many optimality properties in the absence of nuisance parameters. In the presence of nuisance parameters, however, there are many other priors which emerge as optimal depending on the criterion selected. One new feature in this article is that a prior different from Jeffreys' is shown to be optimal under the chi-square divergence criterion even in the absence of nuisance parameters. The latter is also invariant under one-to-one reparameterization.},

For this dataset we show a fundamental bound relating the classification error rate to the average distance to the nearest misclassification, which is independent of the model. We train different neural network architectures on this dataset and show their error sets approach this theoretical bound. As a result of the theory, the vulnerability of machine learning models to small adversarial perturbations is a logical consequence of the amount of test error observed. We hope that our theoretical analysis of this foundational synthetic case will point a way forward to explore how the geometry of complex real-world data sets leads to adversarial examples.},

This is particularly important in domains with nonstationary feature distributions or with input sensor failures. A common approach to achieving such robustness is to introduce regularization which spreads the weight more evenly between the features. However, this strategy is very generic, and cannot induce robustness specifically tailored to the classification task at hand. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for avoiding single feature over-weighting by analyzing robustness using a game theoretic formalization. We develop classifiers which are optimally resilient to deletion of features in a minimax sense, and show how to construct such classifiers using quadratic programming. We illustrate the applicability of our methods on spam filtering and handwritten digit recognition tasks, where feature deletion is indeed a realistic noise model.},

Previous work has shown that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as front-end can learn effective representations from the raw waveform. However, due to the large dimension of raw audio waveforms, pooling layers are usually used aggressively between temporal convolutional layers. In essence, these pooling layers perform operations that are similar to signal downsampling, which may lead to temporal aliasing according to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. This paper explores, using a series of experiments, if and how this aliasing effect impacts modern deep CNN-based models.},

  abstract = {Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It takes sequences of information and uses recurrent mechanisms and gate techniques. LSTM has many advantages over other feedforward and recurrent NNs in modeling of time series, such as audio and video. However, in non-linear system modeling normal LSTM does not work well(Wang, 2017). In this paper, we combine LSTM with NN, and use the advantages. The novel neural model consists of hierarchical recurrent networks and one multilayer perceptron. We design a special learning algorithm which uses backpropagation, and backpropagation through time methods. We use two non-linear system examples to compare our neural modeling with other well known methods. The results show that for the simulation model (only the test input is used and the past test output is not used), the modified LSTM model proposed in this paper is much better than the other existing neural models.},

Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.},

In this paper, we make the case that sparse representations of the input data are a crucial tool for combating such attacks. For linear classifiers, we show that a sparsifying front end is provably effective against \${\textbackslash}ell\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$-bounded attacks, reducing output distortion due to the attack by a factor of roughly \$K / N\$ where \$N\$ is the data dimension and \$K\$ is the sparsity level. We then extend this concept to DNNs, showing that a "locally linear" model can be used to develop a theoretical foundation for crafting attacks and defenses. Experimental results for the MNIST dataset show the efficacy of the proposed sparsifying front end.},

  abstract = {Background Patient with acute coronary syndrome benefits from early revascularization. However, methods for the selection of patients who require urgent revascularization from a variety of patients visiting the emergency room with chest symptoms is not fully established. Electrocardiogram is an easy and rapid procedure, but may contain crucial information not recognized even by well-trained physicians. Objective To make a prediction model for the needs for urgent revascularization from 12-lead electrocardiogram recorded in the emergency room. Method We developed an artificial intelligence model enabling the detection of hidden information from a 12-lead electrocardiogram recorded in the emergency room. Electrocardiograms obtained from consecutive patients visiting the emergency room at Keio University Hospital from January 2012 to April 2018 with chest discomfort was collected. These data were splitted into validation and derivation dataset with no duplication in each dataset. The artificial intelligence model was constructed to select patients who require urgent revascularization within 48 hours. The model was trained with the derivation dataset and tested using the validation dataset. Results Of the consecutive 39,619 patients visiting the emergency room with chest discomfort, 362 underwent urgent revascularization. Of them, 249 were included in the derivation dataset and the remaining 113 were included in validation dataset. For the control, 300 were randomly selected as derivation dataset and another 130 patients were randomly selected for validation dataset from the 39,317 who did not undergo urgent revascularization. On validation, our artificial intelligence model had predictive value of the c-statistics 0.88 (95\% CI 0.84--0.93) for detecting patients who required urgent revascularization. Conclusions Our artificial intelligence model provides information to select patients who need urgent revascularization from only 12-leads electrocardiogram in those visiting the emergency room with chest discomfort.},

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest arrhythmia in clinical practice and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Various predictive scores for new-onset AF have been proposed, but so far, none have been widely used in clinical practice. CHARGE-AF score was developed from a pooled diverse population from three large cohorts (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, Cardiovascular Health Study and Framingham Heart Study). A simple 5-year predictive model includes the variables of age, race, height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, current smoking, use of antihypertensive medication, diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction and heart failure. Recent studies report that the CHARGE-AF score has good discrimination for incident AF and seems to be a promising prediction model for this arrhythmia. New screening tools (smartphone apps, smartwatches) are rapidly developing for AF detection. Therefore, the wide application of the CHARGE-AF score in clinical practice and the upcoming usage of mobile health technologies and smartwatches may result in better AF prediction and adequate stroke prevention, especially in high-risk patients.},

Our technique is then used to formulate training a neural network with a bounded Lipschitz constant as a constrained optimisation problem that can be solved using projected stochastic gradient methods. Our evaluation study shows that, in isolation, our method performs comparatively to state-of-the-art regularisation techniques. Moreover, when combined with existing approaches to regularising neural networks the performance gains are cumulative. We also provide evidence that the hyperparameters are intuitive to tune and demonstrate how the choice of norm for computing the Lipschitz constant impacts the resulting model.},

However, the results in that work relied on recurrent-neural-network-specific objective functions, which are difficult to integrate with existing large vocabulary speech recognition systems. This paper investigates the use of DBLSTM as an acoustic model in a standard neural network-HMM hybrid system. We find that a DBLSTM-HMM hybrid gives equally good results on TIMIT as the previous work. It also outperforms both GMM and deep network benchmarks on a subset of the Wall Street Journal corpus. However the improvement in word error rate over the deep network is modest, despite a great increase in framelevel accuracy. We conclude that the hybrid approach with DBLSTM appears to be well suited for tasks where acoustic modelling predominates. Further investigation needs to be conducted to understand how to better leverage the improvements in frame-level accuracy towards better word error rates.},

  abstract = {Confidence calibration -- the problem of predicting probability estimates representative of the true correctness likelihood -- is important for classification models in many applications. We discover that modern neural networks, unlike those from a decade ago, are poorly calibrated. Through extensive experiments, we observe that depth, width, weight decay, and Batch Normalization are important factors influencing calibration. We evaluate the performance of various post-processing calibration methods on state-ofthe-art architectures with image and document classification datasets. Our analysis and experiments not only offer insights into neural network learning, but also provide a simple and straightforward recipe for practical settings: on most datasets, temperature scaling -- a singleparameter variant of Platt Scaling -- is surprisingly effective at calibrating predictions.},

Here, we apply GANs to generate synthetic DNA sequences encoding for proteins of variable length. We propose a novel feedback-loop architecture, called Feedback GAN (FBGAN), to optimize the synthetic gene sequences for desired properties using an external function analyzer. The proposed architecture also has the advantage that the analyzer need not be differentiable. We apply the feedback-loop mechanism to two examples: 1) generating synthetic genes coding for antimicrobial peptides, and 2) optimizing synthetic genes for the secondary structure of their resulting peptides. A suite of metrics demonstrate that the GAN generated proteins have desirable biophysical properties. The FBGAN architecture can also be used to optimize GAN-generated datapoints for useful properties in domains beyond genomics.},

  abstract = {In recent years, various notions of capacity and complexity have been proposed for characterizing the generalization properties of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in deep learning. Some of the popular notions that correlate well with the performance on unseen data are (i) the `flatness' of the local minimum found by SGD, which is related to the eigenvalues of the Hessian, (ii) the ratio of the stepsize \${\textbackslash}eta\$ to the batch-size \$b\$, which essentially controls the magnitude of the stochastic gradient noise, and (iii) the `tail-index', which measures the heaviness of the tails of the network weights at convergence. In this paper, we argue that these three seemingly unrelated perspectives for generalization are deeply linked to each other. We claim that depending on the structure of the Hessian of the loss at the minimum, and the choices of the algorithm parameters \${\textbackslash}eta\$ and \$b\$, the SGD iterates will converge to a {\textbackslash}emph\{heavy-tailed\} stationary distribution. We rigorously prove this claim in the setting of quadratic optimization: we show that even in a simple linear regression problem with independent and identically distributed data whose distribution has finite moments of all order, the iterates can be heavy-tailed with infinite variance. We further characterize the behavior of the tails with respect to algorithm parameters, the dimension, and the curvature. We then translate our results into insights about the behavior of SGD in deep learning. We support our theory with experiments conducted on synthetic data, fully connected, and convolutional neural networks.},

In managed settings, deep learning-based models and especially convolutional deep models have shown promise in electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, but there is a lack of high-performing models for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in real-world scenarios. We aimed to train and validate a deep learning model using ECGs to predict myocardial infarction in real-world emergency department patients. We studied emergency department patients in the Stockholm region between 2007 and 2016 that had an ECG obtained because of their presenting complaint. We developed a deep neural network based on convolutional layers similar to a residual network. Inputs to the model were ECG tracing, age, and sex; and outputs were the probabilities of three mutually exclusive classes: non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and control status, as registered in the SWEDEHEART and other registries. We used an ensemble of five models. Among 492,226 ECGs in 214,250 patients, 5,416 were recorded with an NSTEMI, 1,818 a STEMI, and 485,207 without a myocardial infarction. In a random test set, our model could discriminate STEMIs/NSTEMIs from controls with a C-statistic of 0.991/0.832 and had a Brier score of 0.001/0.008. The model obtained a similar performance in a temporally separated test set of the study sample, and achieved a C-statistic of 0.985 and a Brier score of 0.002 in discriminating STEMIs from controls in an external test set. We developed and validated a deep learning model with excellent performance in discriminating between control, STEMI, and NSTEMI on the presenting ECG of a real-world sample of the important population of all-comers to the emergency department. Hence, deep learning models for ECG decision support could be valuable in the emergency department.},

  abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition is increasingly widespread in medical and commercial devices, necessitating the development of automated interpretation strategies. Recently, deep neural networks have been used to automatically analyze ECG tracings and outperform physicians in detecting certain rhythm irregularities1. However, deep learning classifiers are susceptible to adversarial examples, which are created from raw data to fool the classifier such that it assigns the example to the wrong class, but which are undetectable to the human eye2,3. Adversarial examples have also been created for medical-related tasks4,5. However, traditional attack methods to create adversarial examples do not extend directly to ECG signals, as such methods introduce square-wave artefacts that are not physiologically plausible. Here we develop a method to construct smoothed adversarial examples for ECG tracings that are invisible to human expert evaluation and show that a deep learning model for arrhythmia detection from single-lead ECG6 is vulnerable to this type of attack. Moreover, we provide a general technique for collating and perturbing known adversarial examples to create multiple new ones. The susceptibility of deep learning ECG algorithms to adversarial misclassification implies that care should be taken when evaluating these models on ECGs that may have been altered, particularly when incentives for causing misclassification exist.},

Widely available digital ECG data and the algorithmic paradigm of deep learning2 present an opportunity to substantially improve the accuracy and scalability of automated ECG analysis. However, a comprehensive evaluation of an end-to-end deep learning approach for ECG analysis across a wide variety of diagnostic classes has not been previously reported. Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) to classify 12 rhythm classes using 91,232 single-lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device. When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the DNN achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97. The average F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value and sensitivity, for the DNN (0.837) exceeded that of average cardiologists (0.780). With specificity fixed at the average specificity achieved by cardiologists, the sensitivity of the DNN exceeded the average cardiologist sensitivity for all rhythm classes. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end deep learning approach can classify a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from single-lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists. If confirmed in clinical settings, this approach could reduce the rate of misdiagnosed computerized ECG interpretations and improve the efficiency of expert human ECG interpretation by accurately triaging or prioritizing the most urgent conditions.},

Recently, the performance levels of 3D CNNs in the field of action recognition have improved significantly. However, to date, conventional research has only explored relatively shallow 3D architectures. We examine the architectures of various 3D CNNs from relatively shallow to very deep ones on current video datasets. Based on the results of those experiments, the following conclusions could be obtained: (i) ResNet-18 training resulted in significant overfitting for UCF-101, HMDB-51, and ActivityNet but not for Kinetics. (ii) The Kinetics dataset has sufficient data for training of deep 3D CNNs, and enables training of up to 152 ResNets layers, interestingly similar to 2D ResNets on ImageNet. ResNeXt-101 achieved 78.4\% average accuracy on the Kinetics test set. (iii) Kinetics pretrained simple 3D architectures outperforms complex 2D architectures, and the pretrained ResNeXt-101 achieved 94.5\% and 70.2\% on UCF-101 and HMDB-51, respectively. The use of 2D CNNs trained on ImageNet has produced significant progress in various tasks in image. We believe that using deep 3D CNNs together with Kinetics will retrace the successful history of 2D CNNs and ImageNet, and stimulate advances in computer vision for videos.

  abstract = {Successful deep learning models often involve training neural network architectures that contain more parameters than the number of training samples. Such overparametrized models have been extensively studied in recent years, and the virtues of overparametrization have been established from both the statistical perspective, via the double-descent phenomenon, and the computational perspective via the structural properties of the optimization landscape. Despite the remarkable success of deep learning architectures in the overparametrized regime, it is also well known that these models are highly vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations in their inputs. Even when adversarially trained, their performance on perturbed inputs (robust generalization) is considerably worse than their best attainable performance on benign inputs (standard generalization). It is thus imperative to understand how overparametrization fundamentally affects robustness. In this paper, we will provide a precise characterization of the role of overparametrization on robustness by focusing on random features regression models (two-layer neural networks with random first layer weights). We consider a regime where the sample size, the input dimension and the number of parameters grow in proportion to each other, and derive an asymptotically exact formula for the robust generalization error when the model is adversarially trained. Our developed theory reveals the nontrivial effect of overparametrization on robustness and indicates that for adversarially trained random features models, high overparametrization can hurt robust generalization.},

  abstract = {Interpolators---estimators that achieve zero training error---have attracted growing attention in machine learning, mainly because state-of-the art neural networks appear to be models of this type. In this paper, we study minimum \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$ norm ("ridgeless") interpolation in high-dimensional least squares regression. We consider two different models for the feature distribution: a linear model, where the feature vectors \$x\_i {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}p\$ are obtained by applying a linear transform to a vector of i.i.d. entries, \$x\_i = {\textbackslash}Sigma{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\} z\_i\$ (with \$z\_i {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}p\$); and a nonlinear model, where the feature vectors are obtained by passing the input through a random one-layer neural network, \$x\_i = {\textbackslash}varphi(W z\_i)\$ (with \$z\_i {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$, \$W {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{p {\textbackslash}times d\}\$ a matrix of i.i.d. entries, and \${\textbackslash}varphi\$ an activation function acting componentwise on \$W z\_i\$). We recover---in a precise quantitative way---several phenomena that have been observed in large-scale neural networks and kernel machines, including the "double descent" behavior of the prediction risk, and the potential benefits of overparametrization.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94\% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26\% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66\%). To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass human-level performance (5.1\%, Russakovsky et al.) on this visual recognition challenge.},

Recent work on Unitary Recurrent Neural Networks (uRNNs) have been used to address this issue and in some cases, exceed the capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs). We propose a simpler and novel update scheme to maintain orthogonal recurrent weight matrices without using complex valued matrices. This is done by parametrizing with a skew-symmetric matrix using the Cayley transform; such a parametrization is unable to represent matrices with negative one eigenvalues, but this limitation is overcome by scaling the recurrent weight matrix by a diagonal matrix consisting of ones and negative ones. The proposed training scheme involves a straightforward gradient calculation and update step. In several experiments, the proposed scaled Cayley orthogonal recurrent neural network (scoRNN) achieves superior results with fewer trainable parameters than other unitary RNNs.},

Specifically, we test for a general form of invariance, linearization, in which the action of a transformation is confined to a low-dimensional subspace. Given two reference images (typically, differing by some transformation), we synthesize a sequence of images lying on a path between them that is of minimal length in the space of the representation (a "representational geodesic"). If the transformation relating the two reference images is linearized by the representation, this sequence should follow the gradual evolution of this transformation. We use this method to assess the invariance properties of a state-of-the-art image classification network and find that geodesics generated for image pairs differing by translation, rotation, and dilation do not evolve according to their associated transformations. Our method also suggests a remedy for these failures, and following this prescription, we show that the modified representation is able to linearize a variety of geometric image transformations.},

We present a multiple-shooting formulation for the optimization of virtual constraints, combining the stability-friendly properties of HZD with an optimization-conducive problem formulation.

  abstract = {Causal inference from observational data is the goal of many data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often frowned upon data analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term "data science" provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we organize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: description, prediction, and causal inference. An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science. Specifically, causal analyses typically require not only good data and algorithms, but also domain expert knowledge. We discuss the implications for the use of data science to guide decision-making in the real world and to train data scientists.},

An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This article provides an overview of this progress and represents the shared views of four research groups that have had recent successes in using DNNs for acoustic modeling in speech recognition.},

For most of that time, the dominant approach to artificial intelligence was inspired by logic: researchers assumed that the essence of intelligence was manipulating symbolic expressions, using rules of inference. This approach produced expert systems and graphical models that attempted to automate the reasoning processes of experts. In the last decade, however, a radically different approach to artificial intelligence, called deep learning, has produced major breakthroughs and is now used on billions of digital devices for complex tasks such as speech recognition, image interpretation, and language translation. The purpose of this Viewpoint is to give health care professionals an intuitive understanding of the technology underlying deep learning. In an accompanying Viewpoint, Naylor1 outlines some of the factors propelling adoption of this technology in medicine and health care.},

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modelled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

This scientific statement reviews current concepts of risk evaluation and proposes standards for the critical appraisal of risk assessment methods. An adequate evaluation of a novel risk marker requires a sound research design, a representative at-risk population, and an adequate number of outcome events. Studies of a novel marker should report the degree to which it adds to the prognostic information provided by standard risk markers. No single statistical measure provides all the information needed to assess a novel marker, so measures of both discrimination and accuracy should be reported. The clinical value of a marker should be assessed by its effect on patient management and outcomes. In general, a novel risk marker should be evaluated in several phases, including initial proof of concept, prospective validation in independent populations, documentation of incremental information when added to standard risk markers, assessment of effects on patient management and outcomes, and ultimately, cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

However, recent research has shown that in sufficiently high-dimensional linear classification problems, the SVM can generalize well despite a proliferation of support vectors where all training examples are support vectors.

Simply speaking, Lasso is a shrinkage method in a regression setup which selects the model and estimates the parameters simultaneously. Compared to the conventional information-based methods such as AIC and BIC, the Lasso approach avoids computationally intensive and exhaustive search. On the other hand, compared to the existing subset selection methods with parameter constraints such as the top-down and bottom-up strategies, the Lasso method is computationally efficient and its result is robust to the order of series included in the autoregressive model. We derive the asymptotic theorem for the Lasso estimator under VAR processes. Simulation results demonstrate that the Lasso method performs better than several conventional subset selection methods for small samples in terms of prediction mean squared errors and estimation errors under various settings. The methodology is applied to modeling U.S. macroeconomic data for illustration.},

To exploit both the powerful representational capacity of GCNs and the great expressive power of GPs, we investigate similar properties of infinitely wide GCNs. More specifically, we propose a GP regression model via GCNs{\textasciitilde}(GPGC) for graph-based semi-supervised learning. In the process, we formulate the kernel matrix computation of GPGC in an iterative analytical form. Finally, we derive a conditional distribution for the labels of unobserved nodes based on the graph structure, labels for the observed nodes, and the feature matrix of all the nodes. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the semi-supervised classification performance of GPGC and demonstrate that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin on all the datasets while being efficient.},

Specifically, we divide the features obtained by the IB method into robust features (content information) and non-robust features (style information) via the instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects. With the utilization of such a framework, the influence of non-robust features could be mitigated to strengthen the adversarial robustness. We make an analysis of the effectiveness of our proposed method.

In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

  abstract = {Aim: Deep learning's widespread use prompts heightened scrutiny, particularly in the biomedical fields, with a specific focus on model generalizability. This study delves into the influence of training data characteristics on the generalization performance of models, specifically in cardiac abnormality detection. Materials \& methods: Leveraging diverse electrocardiogram datasets, models are trained on subsets with varying characteristics and subsequently compared for performance. Additionally, the introduction of the attention mechanism aims to improve generalizability. Results: Experiments reveal that using a balanced dataset, just 1\% of a large dataset, leads to equal performance in generalization tasks, notably in detecting cardiology abnormalities. Conclusion: This balanced training data notably enhances model generalizability, while the integration of the attention mechanism further refines the model's ability to generalize effectively. This study tackles a common problem for deep learning models: they often struggle when faced with new, unfamiliar data that they have not~been trained on. This phenomenon is also known as performance drop in out-of-distribution generalization. This reduced performance on out-of-distribution generalization is a key focus of the research, aiming to improve the models'~ability to handle diverse data sets beyond their training data. The study examines how the characteristics of the dataset used to train deep learning models affect their ability to detect abnormal heart activities when applied to new, unseen data. Researchers trained these models using various sets of electrocardiogram~(ECG)~data and then evaluated their performance in identifying abnormalities. They also introduced an attention mechanism to enhance the models'~learning capabilities. The attention mechanism in deep learning is like a spotlight that helps the model focus on important information while ignoring less relevant details. The findings were particularly noteworthy. Despite being trained on a small, well-balanced subset of a larger dataset, the models excelled in detecting heart abnormalities in new, unfamiliar data. This training method significantly improved the models'~generalization and performance with unseen data. Furthermore, integrating the attention mechanism substantially enhanced the models'~ability to generalize effectively on new information. Investigate the impact of training data characteristics and attention mechanism on deep learning model generalizability in cardiac abnormality detection. Balanced dataset (1\% of the total) improves model performance in generalization tasks, especially in detecting cardiology abnormalities. The attention mechanism further enhances the model's capacity to comprehend and utilize out-of-distribution data effectively. Utilized multiple electrocardiogram datasets for the study. Trained models on subsets with varying characteristics and evaluated performance. Added attention mechanism to enhance learning capabilities. Balanced training data significantly enhances model generalizability. Attention mechanism improves the model's ability to generalize on out-of-distribution data. Lack of clinical user information in datasets due to privacy and ethical considerations. Future research may consider patient-specific models for improved generalization in biomedical machine learning. Balanced and curated datasets are crucial for training high-performing models in cardiac abnormality detection using deep learning. Attention mechanisms show promise in enhancing model accuracy and generalization.},

Existing OOD detection approaches primarily rely on the output or feature space for deriving OOD scores, while largely overlooking information from the gradient space. In this paper, we present GradNorm, a simple and effective approach for detecting OOD inputs by utilizing information extracted from the gradient space. GradNorm directly employs the vector norm of gradients, backpropagated from the KL divergence between the softmax output and a uniform probability distribution. Our key idea is that the magnitude of gradients is higher for in-distribution (ID) data than that for OOD data, making it informative for OOD detection. GradNorm demonstrates superior performance, reducing the average FPR95 by up to 16.33\% compared to the previous best method.},

Because of significant recent advances in computation and communication technologies, autonomous cars are becoming a reality. Already autonomous car prototype models have covered millions of miles in test driving. Leading technical companies and car manufacturers have invested a staggering amount of resources in autonomous car technology, as they prepare for autonomous cars' full commercialization in the coming years. However, to achieve this goal, several technical and nontechnical issues remain: software complexity, real-time data analytics, and testing and verification are among the greater technical challenges; and consumer stimulation, insurance management, and ethical/moral concerns rank high among the nontechnical issues. Tackling these challenges requires thoughtful solutions that satisfy consumers, industry, and governmental requirements, regulations, and policies. Thus, here we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art results for autonomous car technology. We discuss current issues that hinder autonomous cars' development and deployment on a large scale. We also highlight autonomous car applications that will benefit consumers and many other sectors. Finally, to enable cost-effective, safe, and efficient autonomous cars, we discuss several challenges that must be addressed (and provide helpful suggestions for adoption) by designers, implementers, policymakers, regulatory organizations, and car manufacturers.},

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

The primary target of this algorithm is the class of cardiac action potentials recorded using voltage-sensitive dyes, although the method is also applied to electrocardiographic signals High periodicity is one of the main features of cardiac biosignals. The proposed algorithm exploits this feature in filtering signals with a minimum amount of distortion. The basic idea is to use signal averaging in time to rind the stationary portion of the signal. The residue is found by subtracting the signal average from the corresponding points of the input. After passing through a low-pass filter, the filtered residue (FR) is added back to the signal average to reconstruct the output. The practical implementation of the filter residue algorithm is discussed. Stretching and shrinking operations are the basis for the conversion of quasi-periodic signals into periodic signals, which can then be subjected to the FR algorithm. Various examples are presented, and error estimation is performed to guide the selection of optimal parameters for the algorithm. The ability of the algorithm to reconstruct the variation among beats is demonstrated, and its limitations are discussed.},

  abstract = {Bayesian nonlinear system identification for one of the major classes of dynamic model, the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) model, has not been widely studied to date. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been developed, which tend to be accurate but can also be slow to converge. In this contribution, we present a novel, computationally efficient solution to sparse Bayesian identification of the NARX model using variational inference, which is orders of magnitude faster than MCMC methods. A sparsity-inducing hyper-prior is used to solve the structure detection problem. Key results include: 1. successful demonstration of the method on low signal-to-noise ratio signals (down to 2dB); 2. successful benchmarking in terms of speed and accuracy against a number of other algorithms: Bayesian LASSO, reversible jump MCMC, forward regression orthogonalisation, LASSO and simulation error minimisation with pruning; 3. accurate identification of a real world system, an electroactive polymer; and 4. demonstration for the first time of numerically propagating the estimated nonlinear time-domain model parameter uncertainty into the frequency-domain.},

  abstract = {Random Feature (RF) models are used as efficient parametric approximations of kernel methods. We investigate, by means of random matrix theory, the connection between Gaussian RF models and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR). For a Gaussian RF model with P features, N data points, and a ridge {$\lambda$}, we show that the average (i.e. expected) RF predictor is close to a KRR predictor with an effective ridge {$\lambda$}{\texttildelow}. We show that {$\lambda$}{\texttildelow} {$>$} {$\lambda$} and {$\lambda$}{\texttildelow} {$\lambda$} monotonically as P grows, thus revealing the implicit regularization effect of finite RF sampling. We then compare the risk (i.e. test error) of the {$\lambda$}{\texttildelow}KRR predictor with the average risk of the {$\lambda$}-RF predictor and obtain a precise and explicit bound on their difference. Finally, we empirically find an extremely good agreement between the test errors of the average {$\lambda$}-RF predictor and {$\lambda$}{\texttildelow}-KRR predictor.},

  abstract = {At initialization, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are equivalent to Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit, thus connecting them to kernel methods. We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the network function \$f\_{\textbackslash}theta\$ (which maps input vectors to output vectors) follows the kernel gradient of the functional cost (which is convex, in contrast to the parameter cost) w.r.t. a new kernel: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This kernel is central to describe the generalization features of ANNs. While the NTK is random at initialization and varies during training, in the infinite-width limit it converges to an explicit limiting kernel and it stays constant during training. This makes it possible to study the training of ANNs in function space instead of parameter space. Convergence of the training can then be related to the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK. We prove the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK when the data is supported on the sphere and the non-linearity is non-polynomial. We then focus on the setting of least-squares regression and show that in the infinite-width limit, the network function \$f\_{\textbackslash}theta\$ follows a linear differential equation during training. The convergence is fastest along the largest kernel principal components of the input data with respect to the NTK, hence suggesting a theoretical motivation for early stopping. Finally we study the NTK numerically, observe its behavior for wide networks, and compare it to the infinite-width limit.},

  abstract = {Echo State Networks and Liquid State Machines introduced a new paradigm in artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) training, where an RNN (the reservoir) is generated randomly and only a readout is trained. The paradigm, becoming known as reservoir computing, greatly facilitated the practical application of RNNs and outperformed classical fully trained RNNs in many tasks. It has lately become a vivid research field with numerous extensions of the basic idea, including reservoir adaptation, thus broadening the initial paradigm to using different methods for training the reservoir and the readout. This review systematically surveys both: current ways of generating/adapting the reservoirs and training different types of readouts. It offers a natural conceptual classification of the techniques, which transcends boundaries of the current ``brand-names'' of reservoir methods, and thus aims to help unifying the field and providing the reader with a detailed ``map'' of it.},

  abstract = {Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) includes a comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. Methods We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68\hphantom{,}781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. Findings Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3{$\cdot$}9\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 3{$\cdot$}1--4{$\cdot$}6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7{$\cdot$}2\% (6{$\cdot$}0--8{$\cdot$}4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421--723) to 853 million (642--1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7{$\cdot$}9\% (6{$\cdot$}6--9{$\cdot$}2) for males and 6{$\cdot$}5\% (5{$\cdot$}4--7{$\cdot$}7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95\% UI 2782--3252] per 100\hphantom{,}000 in males vs s1400 [1279--1524] per 100\hphantom{,}000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082--3583] vs 2336 [2154--2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943--3630] vs 5643 [5057--6302]). Interpretation Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.

For linear time-invariant single input/single output systems, this framework unifies and extends existing results on open-loop input design that are based on the finite dimensional asymptotic covariance matrix of the parameter estimates. Basic methods for parametrizing the input spectrum are provided and conditions on these parametrizations that guarantee that all possible covariance matrices for the asymptotic distribution of the parameter estimates can be generated are provided. A wide range of model quality constraints can be handled. In particular, different frequency-by-frequency constraints can be used. This opens up new applications of input design in areas such as robust control. Furthermore, quality specifications can be imposed on all models in a confidence region. Thus, allowing for statements such as "with at least 99\% probability the model quality specifications will be satisfied".},

  abstract = {Despite breakthrough performance, modern learning models are known to be highly vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations in their inputs. While a wide variety of recent \emph{adversarial training} methods have been effective at improving robustness to perturbed inputs (robust accuracy), often this benefit is accompanied by a decrease in accuracy on benign inputs (standard accuracy), leading to a tradeoff between often competing objectives. Complicating matters further, recent empirical evidence suggest that a variety of other factors (size and quality of training data, model size, etc.) affect this tradeoff in somewhat surprising ways. In this paper we provide a precise and comprehensive understanding of the role of adversarial training in the context of linear regression with Gaussian features. In particular, we characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the accuracies achievable by any algorithm regardless of computational power or size of the training data. Furthermore, we precisely characterize the standard/robust accuracy and the corresponding tradeoff achieved by a contemporary mini-max adversarial training approach in a high-dimensional regime where the number of data points and the parameters of the model grow in proportion to each other. Our theory for adversarial training algorithms also facilitates the rigorous study of how a variety of factors (size and quality of training data, model overparametrization etc.) affect the tradeoff between these two competing accuracies.},

This approach appears particularly promising for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this work, we present a new architecture for implementing an Efficient Unitary Neural Network (EUNNs); its main advantages can be summarized as follows. Firstly, the representation capacity of the unitary space in an EUNN is fully tunable, ranging from a subspace of SU(N) to the entire unitary space. Secondly, the computational complexity for training an EUNN is merely O(1) per parameter. Finally, we test the performance of EUNNs on the standard copying task, the pixelpermuted MNIST digit recognition benchmark as well as the Speech Prediction Test (TIMIT). We find that our architecture significantly outperforms both other state-of-the-art unitary RNNs and the LSTM architecture, in terms of the final performance and/or the wall-clock training speed. EUNNs are thus promising alternatives to RNNs and LSTMs for a wide variety of applications.},

In settings where the dimension of the observations is comparable to the sample size, upward bias in sample eigenvalues and inconsistency of sample eigenvectors are among the most notable phenomena that appear. These phenomena, and the limiting behavior of the rescaled extreme sample eigenvalues, have recently been investigated in detail under the spiked covariance model. The behavior of the bulk of the sample eigenvalues under weak distributional assumptions on the observations has been described. These results have been exploited to develop new estimation and hypothesis testing methods for the population covariance matrix. Furthermore, partly in response to these phenomena, alternative classes of estimation procedures have been developed by exploiting sparsity of the eigenvectors or the covariance matrix. This paper gives an orientation to these areas.},

The ByteNet is a one-dimensional convolutional neural network that is composed of two parts, one to encode the source sequence and the other to decode the target sequence. The two network parts are connected by stacking the decoder on top of the encoder and preserving the temporal resolution of the sequences. To address the differing lengths of the source and the target, we introduce an efficient mechanism by which the decoder is dynamically unfolded over the representation of the encoder. The ByteNet uses dilation in the convolutional layers to increase its receptive field. The resulting network has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and it sidesteps the need for excessive memorization. The ByteNet decoder attains state-of-the-art performance on character-level language modelling and outperforms the previous best results obtained with recurrent networks. The ByteNet also achieves state-of-the-art performance on character-to-character machine translation on the English-to-German WMT translation task, surpassing comparable neural translation models that are based on recurrent networks with attentional pooling and run in quadratic time. We find that the latent alignment structure contained in the representations reflects the expected alignment between the tokens.},

Moreover, as the average age of individuals increases around the world, early detection and diagnosis of AF become even more pressing. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture for the detection of normal sinus rhythm, AF, other abnormal rhythms, and noise. APPROACH: We have demonstrated through a systematic approach many hyperparameters, input sets, and optimization methods that yielded influence in both training time and performance accuracy. We have focused on these properties to identify an optimal 13-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model which was trained on 8528 short single-lead ECG recordings and evaluated on a test dataset of 3658 recordings. MAIN RESULTS: The proposed CNN architecture achieved a state-of-the-art performance in identifying normal, AF and other rhythms with an average F 1-score of 0.83. SIGNIFICANCE: We have presented a robust deep learning-based architecture that can identify abnormal cardiac rhythms using short single-lead ECG recordings. The proposed architecture is computationally fast and can also be used in real-time cardiac arrhythmia detection applications.},

  abstract = {Recurrent neural networks are known for their notorious exploding and vanishing gradient problem (EVGP). This problem becomes more evident in tasks where the information needed to correctly solve them exist over long time scales, because EVGP prevents important gradient components from being back-propagated adequately over a large number of steps. We introduce a simple stochastic algorithm (h-detach) that is specific to LSTM optimization and targeted towards addressing this problem. Specifically, we show that when the LSTM weights are large, the gradient components through the linear path (cell state) in the LSTM computational graph get suppressed. Based on the hypothesis that these components carry information about long term dependencies (which we show empirically), their suppression can prevent LSTMs from capturing them. Our algorithm1 prevents gradients flowing through this path from getting suppressed, thus allowing the LSTM to capture such dependencies better. We show significant improvements over vanilla LSTM gradient based training in terms of convergence speed, robustness to seed and learning rate, and generalization using our modification of LSTM gradient on various benchmark datasets.},

The primary outcome was a composite of death from coronary heart disease (CHD) and nonfatal myocardial infarction. There was a 31\% relative reduction in the primary outcome with pravastatin. There was similar reduction in risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, death from CHD and death from all cardiovascular causes with no increased risk of death from non-cardiovascular causes nor an increase in incident cancers.},

To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textbackslash}left(N{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}right)\$ to \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textbackslash}left(N{\textbackslash}right)\$, where \$N\$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.},

We then show how DeepSurv models the relationship between a patient's features and effectiveness of different treatment options to show how DeepSurv can be used to provide individual treatment recommendations. Finally, we train DeepSurv on real clinical studies to demonstrate how it's personalized treatment recommendations would increase the survival time of a set of patients.

This ensures eigenvalues with unit norm and thus stable dynamics and training. However this comes at the cost of reduced expressivity due to the limited variety of orthogonal transformations. We propose a novel connectivity structure based on the Schur decomposition and a splitting of the Schur form into normal and non-normal parts. This allows to parametrize matrices with unit-norm eigenspectra without orthogonality constraints on eigenbases. The resulting architecture ensures access to a larger space of spectrally constrained matrices, of which orthogonal matrices are a subset. This crucial difference retains the stability advantages and training speed of orthogonal RNNs while enhancing expressivity, especially on tasks that require computations over ongoing input sequences.},

These methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data, say \$32\$-\$512\$ data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions - and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. We discuss several strategies to attempt to help large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap.},

Specifically, we analyze the increase in perplexity when prior context words are shuffled, replaced, or dropped. On two standard datasets, Penn Treebank and WikiText-2, we find that the model is capable of using about 200 tokens of context on average, but sharply distinguishes nearby context (recent 50 tokens) from the distant history. The model is highly sensitive to the order of words within the most recent sentence, but ignores word order in the long-range context (beyond 50 tokens), suggesting the distant past is modeled only as a rough semantic field or topic. We further find that the neural caching model (Grave et al., 2017b) especially helps the LSTM to copy words from within this distant context. Overall, our analysis not only provides a better understanding of how neural LMs use their context, but also sheds light on recent success from cache-based models.},

The key idea is to view the high-dimensional internal state of a neural net as an aid, not an obstacle. We show how to use CAVs as part of a technique, Testing with CAVs (TCAV), that uses directional derivatives to quantify the degree to which a user-defined concept is important to a classification result--for example, how sensitive a prediction of zebra is to the presence of stripes. Using the domain of image classification as a testing ground, we describe how CAVs may be used to explore hypotheses and generate insights for a standard image classification network as well as a medical application.},

In this work, we exploit recent progress in end-to-end speech recognition to create a single multilingual speech recognition system capable of recognizing any of the languages seen in training. To do so, we propose the use of a universal character set that is shared among all languages. We also create a language-specific gating mechanism within the network that can modulate the network's internal representations in a language-specific way. We evaluate our proposed approach on the Microsoft Cortana task across three languages and show that our system outperforms both the individual monolingual systems and systems built with a multi-task learning approach. We also show that this model can be used to initialize a monolingual speech recognizer, and can be used to create a bilingual model for use in code-switching scenarios.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

Its purpose is to foster understanding of how the modern ECG is derived and displayed and to establish standards that will improve the accuracy and usefulness of the ECG in practice. Derivation of representative waveforms and measurements based on global intervals are described. Special emphasis is placed on digital signal acquisition and computer-based signal processing, which provide automated measurements that lead to computer-generated diagnostic statements. Lead placement, recording methods, and waveform presentation are reviewed. Throughout the statement, recommendations for ECG standards are placed in context of the clinical implications of evolving ECG technology.}

  abstract = {A conventional wisdom in statistical learning is that large models require strong regularization to prevent overfitting. Here we show that this rule can be violated by linear regression in the underdetermined \$n{\textbackslash}ll p\$ situation under realistic conditions. Using simulations and real-life high-dimensional data sets, we demonstrate that an explicit positive ridge penalty can fail to provide any improvement over the minimum-norm least squares estimator. Moreover, the optimal value of ridge penalty in this situation can be negative. This happens when the high-variance directions in the predictor space can predict the response variable, which is often the case in the real-world high-dimensional data. In this regime, low-variance directions provide an implicit ridge regularization and can make any further positive ridge penalty detrimental. We prove that augmenting any linear model with random covariates and using minimum-norm estimator is asymptotically equivalent to adding the ridge penalty. We use a spiked covariance model as an analytically tractable example and prove that the optimal ridge penalty in this case is negative when \$n{\textbackslash}ll p\$.},

In clinical applications for example, it might not be clear from a CT scan alone which particular region is cancer tissue. Therefore a group of graders typically produces a set of diverse but plausible segmentations. We consider the task of learning a distribution over segmentations given an input. To this end we propose a generative segmentation model based on a combination of a U-Net with a conditional variational autoencoder that is capable of efficiently producing an unlimited number of plausible hypotheses. We show on a lung abnormalities segmentation task and on a Cityscapes segmentation task that our model reproduces the possible segmentation variants as well as the frequencies with which they occur, doing so significantly better than published approaches. These models could have a high impact in real-world applications, such as being used as clinical decision-making algorithms accounting for multiple plausible semantic segmentation hypotheses to provide possible diagnoses and recommend further actions to resolve the present ambiguities.},

Their robustness is also tested and compared when the system is subjected to parameter variations and disturbance signals. Further, dynamic back-propagation algorithm is used to update the parameters associated with these neural networks. Four dynamical systems of different complexities including motor-driven robotic link are considered on which the comparative study is performed. The simulation results show the superior performance of DRNN identification model over NARX and MLFFNN identification models.}

It is based on kernel spectral clustering (KSC), a model designed in the Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) framework, with primal-dual setting. The IKSC model is developed to quickly adapt itself to a changing environment, in order to learn evolving clusters with high accuracy. In contrast with other existing incremental spectral clustering approaches, the eigen-updating is performed in a model-based manner, by exploiting one of the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions of the KSC problem. We test the capacities of IKSC with some experiments conducted on computer-generated data and a real-world data-set of PM10 concentrations registered during a pollution episode occurred in Northern Europe in January 2010. We observe that our model is able to precisely recognize the dynamics of shifting patterns in a non-stationary context.},

Many undesirable behaviors of backprop can be avoided with tricks that are rarely exposedin serious technical publications. This paper gives some of those tricks, ando.ers explanations of why they work. Many authors have suggested that second-order optimization methods are advantageous for neural net training. It is shown that most ``classical'' second-order methods are impractical for large neural networks. A few methods are proposed that do not have these limitations.},

We pursue a careful exploration of approaches to allow pooling to learn and to adapt to complex and variable patterns. The two primary directions lie in (1) learning a pooling function via (two strategies of) combining of max and average pooling, and (2) learning a pooling function in the form of a tree-structured fusion of pooling filters that are themselves learned. In our experiments every generalized pooling operation we explore improves performance when used in place of average or max pooling. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed pooling operations provide a boost in invariance properties relative to conventional pooling and set the state of the art on several widely adopted benchmark datasets; they are also easy to implement, and can be applied within various deep neural network architectures. These benefits come with only a light increase in computational overhead during training and a very modest increase in the number of model parameters.},

However, the often complex loss landscapes of neural networks (NNs) have made a theory of learning dynamics elusive. In this work, we show that for wide NNs the learning dynamics simplify considerably and that, in the infinite width limit, they are governed by a linear model obtained from the first-order Taylor expansion of the network around its initial parameters. Furthermore, mirroring the correspondence between wide Bayesian NNs and Gaussian processes (GPs), gradient-based training of wide NNs with a squared loss produces test set predictions drawn from a GP with a particular compositional kernel. While these theoretical results are only exact in the infinite width limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the predictions of the original network and those of the linearized version even for finite practically-sized networks. This agreement is robust across different architectures, optimization methods, and loss functions.},

We study the case of an ensemble of linear predictors, where each individual predictor is fit using ordinary least squares on a random submatrix of the data matrix. We show that, under standard Gaussianity assumptions, when the number of features selected for each predictor is optimally tuned, the asymptotic risk of a large ensemble is equal to the asymptotic ridge regression risk, which is known to be optimal among linear predictors in this setting. In addition to eliciting this implicit regularization that results from subsampling, we also connect this ensemble to the dropout technique used in training deep (neural) networks, another strategy that has been shown to have a ridge-like regularizing effect.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have recently seen tremendous success in various computer vision tasks. However, their application to problems with high dimensional input and output, such as high-resolution image and video segmentation or 3D medical imaging, has been limited by various factors. Primarily, in the training stage, it is necessary to store network activations for back propagation. In these settings, the memory requirements associated with storing activations can exceed what is feasible with current hardware, especially for problems in 3D. Previously proposed reversible architectures allow one to recalculate activations in the backwards pass instead of storing them. For computer visions tasks, only block reversible networks have been possible because pooling operations are not reversible. Block-reversibility still requires storing a number of activations that grows with the number of blocks. Motivated by the propagation of signals over physical networks, that are governed by the hyperbolic Telegraph equation, in this work we introduce a fully conservative hyperbolic network for problems with high dimensional input and output. We introduce a coarsening operation that allows completely reversible CNNs by using the Discrete Wavelet Transform and its inverse to both coarsen and interpolate the network state and change the number of channels. This means that during training we do not need to store any of the activations from the forward pass, and can train arbitrarily deep networks. We show that fully reversible networks are able to achieve results comparable to the state of the art in image depth estimation and full 3D video segmentation, with a much lower memory footprint that is a constant independent of the network depth.},

This approach is based on a parametrization stemming from Lie group theory through the exponential map. The parametrization transforms the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one over a Euclidean space, for which common first-order optimization methods can be used. The theoretical results presented are general enough to cover the special orthogonal group, the unitary group and, in general, any connected compact Lie group. We discuss how this and other parametrizations can be computed efficiently through an implementation trick, making numerically complex parametrizations usable at a negligible runtime cost in neural networks. In particular, we apply our results to RNNs with orthogonal recurrent weights, yielding a new architecture called expRNN. We demonstrate how our method constitutes a more robust approach to optimization with orthogonal constraints, showing faster, accurate, and more stable convergence in several tasks designed to test RNNs.},

Our upper bounds on the risk are of a multiple-descent shape for the various scalings of d = n\textsuperscript{{$\alpha$}}, {$\alpha\in$}(0,1), for the input dimension d and sample size n. Empirical evidence supports our finding that minimum-norm interpolants in RKHS can exhibit this unusual non-monotonicity in sample size; furthermore, locations of the peaks in our experiments match our theoretical predictions. Since gradient flow on appropriately initialized wide neural networks converges to a minimum-norm interpolant with respect to a certain kernel, our analysis also yields novel estimation and generalization guarantees for these over-parametrized models. At the heart of our analysis is a study of spectral properties of the random kernel matrix restricted to a filtration of eigen-spaces of the population covariance operator, and may be of independent interest.},

Here we propose that the age predicted by artificial intelligence (AI) from the raw ECG tracing (ECG-age) can be a measure of cardiovascular health and provide prognostic information. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to predict a patient9s age from the 12-lead ECG using data from patients that underwent an ECG from 2010 to 2017 - the CODE study cohort (n=1,558,415 patients). On the 15\% hold-out CODE test split, patients with ECG-age more than 8 years greater than chronological age had a higher mortality rate (hazard ratio (HR) 1.79, p\&lt;0.001) in a mean follow-up of 3.67 years, whereas those with ECG-age more than 8 years less than chronological age had a lower mortality rate (HR 0.78, p\&lt;0.001). Similar results were obtained in the external cohorts ELSA-Brasil (n=14,236) and SaMi-Trop (n=1,631). The ability to predict mortality from the ECG predicted age remains even when we adjust the model for cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, even for apparent normal ECGs, having a predicted ECG-age 8 or more years greater than chronological age remained a statistically significant predictor of risk (HR 1.53, p\&lt;0.001 in CODE 15\% test split). These results show that AI-enabled analysis of the ECG can add prognostic information to the interpretation of the 12-lead ECGs.},

This study evaluated the ability of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) to identify hospitalized patients with a high risk of mortality in a multisite randomized controlled trial involving 39 physicians and 15,965 patients. The AI-ECG alert intervention included an AI report and warning messages delivered to the physicians, flagging patients predicted to be at high risk of mortality. The trial met its primary outcome, finding that implementation of the AI-ECG alert was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality within 90 days: 3.6\% patients in the intervention group died within 90 days, compared to 4.3\% in the control group (4.3\%) (hazard ratio (HR)\,=\,0.83, 95\% confidence interval (CI)\,=\,0.70--0.99). A prespecified analysis showed that reduction in all-cause mortality associated with the AI-ECG alert was observed primarily in patients with high-risk ECGs (HR\,=\,0.69, 95\% CI\,=\,0.53--0.90). In analyses of secondary outcomes, patients in the intervention group with high-risk ECGs received increased levels of intensive care compared to the control group; for the high-risk ECG group of patients, implementation of the AI-ECG alert was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of cardiac death (0.2\% in the intervention arm versus 2.4\% in the control arm, HR\,=\,0.07, 95\% CI\,=\,0.01--0.56). While the precise means by which implementation of the AI-ECG alert led to decreased mortality are to be fully elucidated, these results indicate that such implementation assists in the detection of high-risk patients, prompting timely clinical care and reducing mortality.

  abstract = {Learning long-term temporal dependencies with recurrent neural networks can be a difficult problem. It has recently been shown that a class of recurrent neural networks called NARX networks perform much better than conventional recurrent neural networks for learning certain simple long-term dependency problems. The intuitive explanation for this behavior is that the output memories of a NARX network can be manifested as jump-ahead connections in the time-unfolded network. These jump-ahead connections can propagate gradient information more efficiently, thus reducing the sensitivity of the network to long-term dependencies. This work gives empirical justification to our hypothesis that similar improvements in learning long-term dependencies can be achieved with other classes of recurrent neural network axchitectures simply by increasing the order of the embedded memory. In particular we explore the impact of learning simple long-term dependency problems on three classes of recurrent neural network architectures: globally recurrent networks, locally recurrent networks, and NARX (output feedback) networks. Comparing the performance of these architectures with different orders of embedded memory on two simple long-term dependencies problems shows that all of these classes of network architectures demonstrate significant improvement on learning long-term dependencies when the orders of embedded memory are increased. These results can be important to a user comfortable with a specific recurrent neural network architecture because simply increasing the embedding memory order of that architecture will make it more robust to the problem of long-term dependency learning.},

  abstract = {It has previously been shown that gradient-descent learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks can perform poorly on tasks that involve long-term dependencies, i.e. those problems for which the desired output depends on inputs presented at times far in the past. We show that the long-term dependencies problem is lessened for a class of architectures called nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous (NARX) recurrent neural networks, which have powerful representational capabilities. We have previously reported that gradient descent learning can be more effective in NARX networks than in recurrent neural network architectures that have ``hidden states'' on problems including grammatical inference and nonlinear system identification. Typically, the network converges much faster and generalizes better than other networks. The results in this paper are consistent with this phenomenon. We present some experimental results which show that NARX networks can often retain information for two to three times as long as conventional recurrent neural networks. We show that although NARX networks do not circumvent the problem of long-term dependencies, they can greatly improve performance on long-term dependency problems. We also describe in detail some of the assumptions regarding what it means to latch information robustly and suggest possible ways to loosen these assumptions},

Careful explanations and pseudo-code are presented for all methods. The authors maintain a focus on the fundamentals by drawing connections between methods and discussing general concepts such as loss functions, maximum likelihood, the bias-variance decomposition, ensemble averaging, kernels and the Bayesian approach along with generally useful tools such as regularization, cross validation, evaluation metrics and optimization methods.

We present a new PMCMC algorithm that we refer to as particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling (PGAS). PGAS provides the data analyst with an off-the-shelf class of Markov kernels that can be used to simulate, for instance, the typically high-dimensional and highly autocorrelated state trajectory in a state-space model. The ancestor sampling procedure enables fast mixing of the PGAS kernel even when using seemingly few particles in the underlying SMC sampler. This is important as it can significantly reduce the computational burden that is typically associated with using SMC. PGAS is conceptually similar to the existing PG with backward simulation (PGBS) procedure. Instead of using separate forward and backward sweeps as in PGBS, however, we achieve the same effect in a single forward sweep. This makes PGAS well suited for addressing inference problems not only in state-space models, but also in models with more complex dependencies, such as non-Markovian, Bayesian nonparametric, and general probabilistic graphical models.},

This tool deals with the limiting spectral distribution of non-Hermitian random matrices, rather than their conventional Hermitian counterparts in the literature. This new tool enables us to evaluate the singular value spectrum of the input-output Jacobian of a fully connected deep ResNet in both linear and nonlinear cases. With the powerful tool of free probability, we conduct an asymptotic analysis of the (limiting) spectrum on the single-layer case, and then extend this analysis to the multi-layer case of an arbitrary number of layers. The asymptotic analysis illustrates the necessity and university of rescaling the classical random initialization by the number of residual units L, so that the squared singular value of the associated Jacobian remains of order O(1), when compared with the large width and depth of the network. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed initialization scheme learns at a speed of orders of magnitudes faster than the classical ones, and thus attests a strong practical relevance of this investigation.},

Our analysis shows how to cope with multiple randomness sources of initialization, label noise, and data sampling (as well as stochastic gradients) with no closed-form solution, and also goes beyond the commonly-used Gaussian/spherical data assumption. Our theoretical results demonstrate that, with SGD training, RF regression still generalizes well for interpolation learning, and is able to characterize the double descent behavior by the unimodality of variance and monotonic decrease of bias. Besides, we also prove that the constant step-size SGD setting incurs no loss in convergence rate when compared to the exact minimum-norm interpolator, as a theoretical justification of using SGD in practice.},

  abstract = {In computer vision, convolutional networks (CNNs) often adopt pooling to enlarge receptive field which has the advantage of low computational complexity. However, pooling can cause information loss and thus is detrimental to further operations such as features extraction and analysis. Recently, dilated filter has been proposed to tradeoff between receptive field size and efficiency. But the accompanying gridding effect can cause a sparse sampling of input images with checkerboard patterns. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-level wavelet CNN (MWCNN) model to achieve a better tradeoff between receptive field size and computational efficiency. The core idea is to embed wavelet transform into CNN architecture to reduce the resolution of feature maps while at the same time, increasing receptive field. Specifically, MWCNN for image restoration is based on U-Net architecture, and inverse wavelet transform (IWT) is deployed to reconstruct the high resolution (HR) feature maps.

  abstract = {Clustering by integrating multiview representations has become a crucial issue for knowledge discovery in heterogeneous environments. However, most prior approaches assume that the multiple representations share the same dimension, limiting their applicability to homogeneous environments. In this paper, we present a novel tensor-based framework for integrating heterogeneous multiview data in the context of spectral clustering. Our framework includes two novel formulations; that is multiview clustering based on the integration of the Frobenius-norm objective function (MC-FR-OI) and that based on matrix integration in the Frobenius-norm objective function (MC-FR-MI). We show that the solutions for both formulations can be computed by tensor decompositions. We evaluated our methods on synthetic data and two real-world data sets in comparison with baseline methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed formulations are effective in integrating multiview data in heterogeneous environments.},

Unlabeled data is, however, not guaranteed to improve classification performance and has in fact been reported to impair the performance in certain cases. A fundamental source of error arises from restrictive assumptions about the unlabeled features, which result in unreliable classifiers. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised learning approach that relaxes such assumptions and is capable of providing classifiers that reliably measure the label uncertainty. The approach is applicable using any generative model with a supervised learning algorithm. We illustrate the approach using both handwritten digit and cloth classification data where the labels are missing at random.},

Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance of both Dropout and DropConnect. We then evaluate DropConnect on a range of datasets, comparing to Dropout, and show state-of-the-art results on several image recoginition benchmarks can be obtained by aggregating multiple DropConnect-trained models.}

For these results it is not assumed that the true system necessarily can be exactly represented within the chosen set of models. In the particular case when the model set contains the system, general consistency results are obtained and commented upon. Rather than to seek an exact description of the system, it is usually more realistic to be content with a suitable approximation of the true system with reasonable complexity properties. Here, the consequences of such a viewpoint are discussed.},

It can be seen as the interface between the real world of applications and the mathematical world of control theory and model abstractions. As such, it is an ubiquitous necessity for successful applications. System identification is a very large topic, with different techniques that depend on the character of the models to be estimated: linear, nonlinear, hybrid, nonparametric, etc. At the same time, the area can be characterized by a small number of leading principles, e.g. to look for sustainable descriptions by proper decisions in the triangle of model complexity, information contents in the data, and effective validation. The area has many facets and there are many approaches and methods. A tutorial or a survey in a few pages is not quite possible. Instead, this presentation aims at giving an overview of the ``science'' side, i.e. basic principles and results and at pointing to open problem areas in the practical, ``art'', side of how to approach and solve a real problem.},

However, the use of artificial intelligence to advance these medical practices and learn new clinical insights from ECGs remains largely unexplored. Utilising a dataset of 2,322,513 ECGs collected from 1,558,772 patients with 7 years of follow-up, we developed a deep learning model with state-of-the-art granularity for the interpretable diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities, gender identification, and hyper- tension screening solely from ECGs, which are then used to stratify the risk of mortality. The model achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.998 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.995-0.999), 0.964 (0.963-0.965), and 0.839 (0.837-0.841) for the three diagnostic tasks separately. Using ECG-predicted results, we find high risks of mortality for subjects with sinus tachycardia (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.24, 1.96-2.57), and atrial fibrillation (adjusted HR of 2.22, 1.99-2.48). We further use salient morphologies produced by the deep learning model to identify key ECG leads that achieved similar performance for the three diagnoses, and we find that the V1 ECG lead is important for hypertension screening and mortality risk stratification of hypertensive cohorts, with an AUC of 0.816 (0.814-0.818) and a univariate HR of 1.70 (1.61-1.79) for the two tasks separately. Using ECGs alone, our developed model showed cardiologist-level accuracy in interpretable cardiac diagnosis, and the advancement in mortality risk stratification; In addition, the potential to facilitate clinical knowledge discovery for gender and hypertension detection which are not readily available.},

We achieved an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.998 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.995-0.999), 0.964 (95\% CI, 0.963-0.965), and 0.839 (95\% CI, 0.837-0.841) for each task, respectively; We provide interpretation of salient morphologies and further identified key ECG leads that achieve similar performance for the three tasks: (i) AVR and V1 leads (AUC=0.990 (95\% CI, 0.982-0.995); (ii) V5 lead (AUC=0.900 (95\% CI, 0.899-0.902)); and (iii) V1 lead (AUC=0.816 (95\% CI, 0.814-0.818)). Using ECGs, our model not only has demonstrated cardiologist-level accuracy in heart diagnosis with interpretability, but also shows its potentials in facilitating clinical knowledge discovery for gender and hypertension detection which are not readily available.},

  abstract = {A giant leap has been made in the past couple of decades with the introduction of kernel-based learning as a mainstay for designing effective nonlinear computational learning algorithms. In view of the geometric interpretation of conditional expectation and the ubiquity of multiscale characteristics in highly complex nonlinear dynamic systems [1]-[3], this paper presents a new orthogonal projection operator wavelet kernel, aiming at developing an efficient computational learning approach for nonlinear dynamical system identification. In the framework of multiresolution analysis, the proposed projection operator wavelet kernel can fulfill the multiscale, multidimensional learning to estimate complex dependencies. The special advantage of the projection operator wavelet kernel developed in this paper lies in the fact that it has a closed-form expression, which greatly facilitates its application in kernel learning. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first closed-form orthogonal projection wavelet kernel reported in the literature. It provides a link between grid-based wavelets and mesh-free kernel-based methods. Simulation studies for identifying the parallel models of two benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems confirm its superiority in model accuracy and sparsity.},

In this article, issues relating to inaccuracy of ECG preprocessing filters are investigated in the context of facilitating efficient ECG interpretation and diagnosis. The discussion covers 4 specific ECG preprocessing applications: anti-aliasing and upper-frequency cutoff, baseline wander suppression and lower-frequency cutoff, line frequency rejection, and muscle artifact reduction. Issues discussed include linear phase, aliasing, distortion, ringing, and attenuation of desired ECG signals. Due to the overlapping power spectrum of signal and noise in acquired ECG data, frequency selective filters must seek a delicate balance between noise removal and deformation of the desired signal. Most importantly, the filtering output should not adversely impact subsequent diagnosis and interpretation. Based on these discussions, several suggestions are made to improve and update existing ECG data preprocessing standards and guidelines.},

In this work we review, demystify, and unify the understanding of diffusion models across both variational and score-based perspectives. We first derive Variational Diffusion Models (VDM) as a special case of a Markovian Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder, where three key assumptions enable tractable computation and scalable optimization of the ELBO. We then prove that optimizing a VDM boils down to learning a neural network to predict one of three potential objectives: the original source input from any arbitrary noisification of it, the original source noise from any arbitrarily noisified input, or the score function of a noisified input at any arbitrary noise level. We then dive deeper into what it means to learn the score function, and connect the variational perspective of a diffusion model explicitly with the Score-based Generative Modeling perspective through Tweedie's Formula. Lastly, we cover how to learn a conditional distribution using diffusion models via guidance.},

ECG analysis can therefore be a crucial first step to help diagnose, understand and predict cardiovascular disorders responsible for 30\% of deaths worldwide. Computational techniques, and more specifically machine learning techniques and computational modelling are powerful tools for classification, clustering and simulation, and they have recently been applied to address the analysis of medical data, especially ECG data. This review describes the computational methods in use for ECG analysis, with a focus on machine learning and 3D computer simulations, as well as their accuracy, clinical implications and contributions to medical advances. The first section focuses on heartbeat classification and the techniques developed to extract and classify abnormal from regular beats. The second section focuses on patient diagnosis from whole recordings, applied to different diseases. The third section presents real-time diagnosis and applications to wearable devices. The fourth section highlights the recent field of personalized ECG computer simulations and their interpretation. Finally, the discussion section outlines the challenges of ECG analysis and provides a critical assessment of the methods presented. The computational methods reported in this review are a strong asset for medical discoveries and their translation to the clinical world may lead to promising advances.},

  abstract = {Many recent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers leverage continuous dynamics to define a transition kernel that efficiently explores a target distribution. In tandem, a focus has been on devising scalable variants that subsample the data and use stochastic gradients in place of full-data gradients in the dynamic simulations. However, such stochastic gradient MCMC samplers have lagged behind their full-data counterparts in terms of the complexity of dynamics considered since proving convergence in the presence of the stochastic gradient noise is non-trivial. Even with simple dynamics, significant physical intuition is often required to modify the dynamical system to account for the stochastic gradient noise. In this paper, we provide a general recipe for constructing MCMC samplers--including stochastic gradient versions--based on continuous Markov processes specified via two matrices. We constructively prove that the framework is complete. That is, any continuous Markov process that provides samples from the target distribution can be written in our framework. We show how previous continuous-dynamic samplers can be trivially "reinvented" in our framework, avoiding the complicated sampler-specific proofs. We likewise use our recipe to straightforwardly propose a new state-adaptive sampler: stochastic gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGRHMC). Our experiments on simulated data and a streaming Wikipedia analysis demonstrate that the proposed SGRHMC sampler inherits the benefits of Riemann HMC, with the scalability of stochastic gradient methods.},

With SWAG, we fit a Gaussian using the SWA solution as the first moment and a low rank plus diagonal covariance also derived from the SGD iterates, forming an approximate posterior distribution over neural network weights; we then sample from this Gaussian distribution to perform Bayesian model averaging. We empirically find that SWAG approximates the shape of the true posterior, in accordance with results describing the stationary distribution of SGD iterates. Moreover, we demonstrate that SWAG performs well on a wide variety of computer vision tasks, including out of sample detection, calibration, and transfer learning, in comparison to many popular alternatives including MC dropout, KFAC Laplace, and temperature scaling.},

In fact, some of the latest findings suggest that the existence of adversarial attacks may be an inherent weakness of deep learning models. To address this problem, we study the adversarial robustness of neural networks through the lens of robust optimization. This approach provides us with a broad and unifying view on much of the prior work on this topic. Its principled nature also enables us to identify methods for both training and attacking neural networks that are reliable and, in a certain sense, universal. In particular, they specify a concrete security guarantee that would protect against any adversary. These methods let us train networks with significantly improved resistance to a wide range of adversarial attacks. They also suggest the notion of security against a first-order adversary as a natural and broad security guarantee. We believe that robustness against such well-defined classes of adversaries is an important stepping stone towards fully resistant deep learning models.

Given a trained recurrent network, we would like to reverse engineer it--to obtain a quantitative, interpretable description of how it solves a particular task. Even for simple tasks, a detailed understanding of how recurrent networks work, or a prescription for how to develop such an understanding, remains elusive. In this work, we use tools from dynamical systems analysis to reverse engineer recurrent networks trained to perform sentiment classification, a foundational natural language processing task. Given a trained network, we find fixed points of the recurrent dynamics and linearize the nonlinear system around these fixed points. Despite their theoretical capacity to implement complex, high-dimensional computations, we find that trained networks converge to highly interpretable, low-dimensional representations. In particular, the topological structure of the fixed points and corresponding linearized dynamics reveal an approximate line attractor within the RNN, which we can use to quantitatively understand how the RNN solves the sentiment analysis task. Finally, we find this mechanism present across RNN architectures (including LSTMs, GRUs, and vanilla RNNs) trained on multiple datasets, suggesting that our findings are not unique to a particular architecture or dataset. Overall, these results demonstrate that surprisingly universal and human interpretable computations can arise across a range of recurrent networks.},

Despite a massive amount of work focusing on making classifiers robust, the task seems quite challenging. In this work, through a theoretical study, we investigate the adversarial risk and robustness of classifiers and draw a connection to the well-known phenomenon of concentration of measure in metric measure spaces. We show that if the metric probability space of the test instance is concentrated, any classifier with some initial constant error is inherently vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. One class of concentrated metric probability spaces are the so-called Levy families that include many natural distributions. In this special case, our attacks only need to perturb the test instance by at most \$O({\textbackslash}sqrt n)\$ to make it misclassified, where \$n\$ is the data dimension. Using our general result about Levy instance spaces, we first recover as special case some of the previously proved results about the existence of adversarial examples. However, many more Levy families are known (e.g., product distribution under the Hamming distance) for which we immediately obtain new attacks that find adversarial examples of distance \$O({\textbackslash}sqrt n)\$. Finally, we show that concentration of measure for product spaces implies the existence of forms of "poisoning" attacks in which the adversary tampers with the training data with the goal of degrading the classifier. In particular, we show that for any learning algorithm that uses \$m\$ training examples, there is an adversary who can increase the probability of any "bad property" (e.g., failing on a particular test instance) that initially happens with non-negligible probability to \${\textbackslash}approx 1\$ by substituting only \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}({\textbackslash}sqrt m)\$ of the examples with other (still correctly labeled) examples.},

  abstract = {Many recent works have shown that adversarial examples that fool classifiers can be found by minimally perturbing a normal input. Recent theoretical results, starting with Gilmer et al. (2018b), show that if the inputs are drawn from a concentrated metric probability space, then adversarial examples with small perturbation are inevitable. A concentrated space has the property that any subset with {\textohm}(1) (e.g., 1/100) measure, according to the imposed distribution, has small distance to almost all (e.g., 99/100) of the points in the space. It is not clear, however, whether these theoretical results apply to actual distributions such as images. This paper presents a method for empirically measuring and bounding the concentration of a concrete dataset which is proven to converge to the actual concentration. We use it to empirically estimate the intrinsic robustness to {$\infty$} and 2 perturbations of several image classification benchmarks. Code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/xiaozhanguva/Measure-Concentration.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Polygenic scores (PGS) summarize the genetic contribution of a person's genotype to a disease or phenotype. They can be used to group participants into different risk categories for diseases, and are also used as covariates in epidemiological analyses. A number of possible ways of calculating PGS have been proposed, and recently there is much interest in methods that incorporate information available in published summary statistics. As there is no inherent information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in summary statistics, a pertinent question is how we can use LD information available elsewhere to supplement such analyses. To answer this question, we propose a method for constructing PGS using summary statistics and a reference panel in a penalized regression framework, which we call lassosum. We also propose a general method for choosing the value of the tuning parameter in the absence of validation data. In our simulations, we showed that pseudovalidation often resulted in prediction accuracy that is comparable to using a dataset with validation phenotype and was clearly superior to the conservative option of setting the tuning parameter of lassosum to its lowest value. We also showed that lassosum achieved better prediction accuracy than simple clumping and P-value thresholding in almost all scenarios. It was also substantially faster and more accurate than the recently proposed LDpred.},

The optimization problem considered is to maximize a reduced Fisher information matrix in any of the classical D-, E-, or A-optimal senses. In contrast to the majority of published work on this topic, we consider the problem in the time domain and subject to constraints on the amplitude of the input signal. This optimization problem is nonconvex. The main result of the paper is a convex relaxation that gives an upper bound accurate to within 2/{$\pi$} of the true maximum. A randomized algorithm is presented for finding a feasible solution which, in a certain sense is expected to be at least 2/{$\pi$} as informative as the globally optimal input signal. In the case of a single constraint on input power, the proposed approach recovers the true global optimum exactly. Extensions to situations with both power and amplitude constraints on both inputs and outputs are given. A simple simulation example illustrates the technique.},

The broad idea is that knowing more about patients enables more accurate predictions of their health risks and, hence, better clinical decisions. This consensus has recently unraveled with respect to a specific covariate, namely race. There have been increasing calls for race-free risk assessment, arguing that using race to predict patient outcomes contributes to racial disparities and inequities in health care. Writers calling for race-free risk assessment have not studied how it would affect the quality of clinical decisions.

DESIGN: Prospective comparison with reference standard of assessment of electrocardiograms by two independent specialists. SETTING: 49 general practices in central England. PARTICIPANTS: 2595 patients aged 65 or over screened for atrial fibrillation as part of the screening for atrial fibrillation in the elderly (SAFE) study; 49 general practitioners and 49 practice nurses. INTERVENTIONS: All electrocardiograms were read with the Biolog interpretative software, and a random sample of 12 lead, limb lead, and single lead thoracic placement electrocardiograms were assessed by general practitioners and practice nurses independently of each other and of the Biolog assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. RESULTS: General practitioners detected 79 out of 99 cases of atrial fibrillation on a 12 lead electrocardiogram (sensitivity 80\%, 95\% confidence interval 71\% to 87\%) and misinterpreted 114 out of 1355 cases of sinus rhythm as atrial fibrillation (specificity 92\%, 90\% to 93\%). Practice nurses detected a similar proportion of cases of atrial fibrillation (sensitivity 77\%, 67\% to 85\%), but had a lower specificity (85\%, 83\% to 87\%). The interpretative software was significantly more accurate, with a specificity of 99\%, but missed 36 of 215 cases of atrial fibrillation (sensitivity 83\%). Combining general practitioners' interpretation with the interpretative software led to a sensitivity of 92\% and a specificity of 91\%. Use of limb lead or single lead thoracic placement electrocardiograms resulted in some loss of specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Many primary care professionals cannot accurately detect atrial fibrillation on an electrocardiogram, and interpretative software is not sufficiently accurate to circumvent this problem, even when combined with interpretation by a general practitioner. Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in the community needs to factor in the reading of electrocardiograms by appropriately trained people.},

  abstract = {Understanding the geometric properties of gradient descent dynamics is a key ingredient in deciphering the recent success of very large machine learning models. A striking observation is that trained over-parameterized models retain some properties of the optimization initialization. This "implicit bias" is believed to be responsible for some favorable properties of the trained models and could explain their good generalization properties. The purpose of this article is threefold. First, we rigorously expose the definition and basic properties of "conservation laws", that define quantities conserved during gradient flows of a given model (e.g. of a ReLU network with a given architecture) with any training data and any loss. Then we explain how to find the maximal number of independent conservation laws by performing finite-dimensional algebraic manipulations on the Lie algebra generated by the Jacobian of the model. Finally, we provide algorithms to: a) compute a family of polynomial laws; b) compute the maximal number of (not necessarily polynomial) independent conservation laws. We provide showcase examples that we fully work out theoretically. Besides, applying the two algorithms confirms for a number of ReLU network architectures that all known laws are recovered by the algorithm, and that there are no other independent laws. Such computational tools pave the way to understanding desirable properties of optimization initialization in large machine learning models.},

Despite nearly 1 century of research, the pathogenesis of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is incompletely understood, the most intriguing challenge of which is the complex host-parasite interaction. Methods and Results--- A systematic review of the literature found in MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIREME, LILACS, and SCIELO was performed to search for relevant references on pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Chagas disease. Evidence from studies in animal models and in anima nobile points to 4 main pathogenetic mechanisms to explain the development of chronic Chagas heart disease: autonomic nervous system derangements, microvascular disturbances, parasite-dependent myocardial aggression, and immune-mediated myocardial injury. Despite its prominent peculiarities, the role of autonomic derangements and microcirculatory disturbances is probably ancillary among causes of chronic myocardial damage. The pathogenesis of chronic Chagas heart disease is dependent on a low-grade but incessant systemic infection with documented immune-adverse reaction. Parasite persistence and immunological mechanisms are inextricably related in the myocardial aggression in the chronic phase of Chagas heart disease. Conclusions--- Most clinical studies have been performed in very small number of patients. Future research should explore the clinical potential implications and therapeutic opportunities of these 2 fundamental underlying pathogenetic mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Background Artificial intelligence is fueling a new revolution in medicine and in the healthcare sector. Despite the growing evidence on the benefits of artificial intelligence there are several aspects that limit the measure of its impact in people's health. It is necessary to assess the current status on the application of AI towards the improvement of people's health in the domains defined by WHO's Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13) and the European Programme of Work (EPW), to inform about trends, gaps, opportunities, and challenges. Objective To perform a systematic overview of systematic reviews on the application of artificial intelligence in the people's health domains as defined in the GPW13 and provide a comprehensive and updated map on the application specialties of artificial intelligence in terms of methodologies, algorithms, data sources, outcomes, predictors, performance, and methodological quality. Methods A systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and IEEEXplore was conducted between January 2015 and June 2021 to collect systematic reviews using a combination of keywords related to the domains of universal health coverage, health emergencies protection, and better health and wellbeing as defined by the WHO's PGW13 and EPW. Eligibility criteria was based on methodological quality and the inclusion of practical implementation of artificial intelligence. Records were classified and labeled using ICD-11 categories into the domains of the GPW13. Descriptors related to the area of implementation, type of modeling, data entities, outcomes and implementation on care delivery were extracted using a structured form and methodological aspects of the included reviews studies was assessed using the AMSTAR checklist. Results The search strategy resulted in the screening of 815 systematic reviews from which 203 were assessed for eligibility and 129 were included in the review. The most predominant domain for artificial intelligence applications was Universal Health Coverage (N~=~98) followed by Health Emergencies (N~=~16) and Better Health and Wellbeing (N~=~15). Neoplasms area on Universal Health Coverage was the disease area featuring most of the applications (21.7~\%, N~=~28). The reviews featured analytics primarily over both public and private data sources (67.44~\%, N~=~87). The most used type of data was medical imaging (31.8~\%, N~=~41) and predictors based on regions of interest and clinical data. The most prominent subdomain of Artificial Intelligence was Machine Learning (43.4~\%, N~=~56), in which Support Vector Machine method was predominant (20.9~\%, N~=~27). Regarding the purpose, the application of Artificial Intelligence I is focused on the prediction of the diseases (36.4~\%, N~=~47). With respect to the validation, more than a half of the reviews (54.3~\%, N~=~70) did not report a validation procedure and, whenever available, the main performance indicator was the accuracy (28.7~\%, N~=~37). According to the methodological quality assessment, a third of the reviews (34.9~\%, N~=~45) implemented methods for analysis the risk of bias and the overall AMSTAR score below was 5 (4.01~{\textpm}~1.93) on all the included systematic reviews. Conclusion Artificial intelligence is being used for disease modelling, diagnose, classification and prediction in the three domains of GPW13. However, the evidence is often limited to laboratory and the level of adoption is largely unbalanced between ICD-11 categoriesand diseases. Data availability is a determinant factor on the developmental stage of artificial intelligence applications. Most of the reviewed studies show a poor methodological quality and are at high risk of bias, which limits the reproducibility of the results and the reliability of translating these applications to real clinical scenarios. The analyzed papers show results only in laboratory and testing scenarios and not in clinical trials nor case studies, limiting the supporting evidence to transfer artificial intelligence to actual care delivery.},

In this paper, we study the relationship between random, wide, fully connected, feedforward networks with more than one hidden layer and Gaussian processes with a recursive kernel definition. We show that, under broad conditions, as we make the architecture increasingly wide, the implied random function converges in distribution to a Gaussian process, formalising and extending existing results by Neal (1996) to deep networks. To evaluate convergence rates empirically, we use maximum mean discrepancy. We then compare finite Bayesian deep networks from the literature to Gaussian processes in terms of the key predictive quantities of interest, finding that in some cases the agreement can be very close. We discuss the desirability of Gaussian process behaviour and review non-Gaussian alternative models from the literature.},

Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7\%~and 1.2\% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4\%~and 2.7\% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5\%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88\%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening.}

  abstract = {Domain adaptation learning is one of the fundamental research topics in pattern recognition and machine learning. This paper introduces a regularized semipaired kernel canonical correlation analysis formulation for learning a latent space for the domain adaptation problem. The optimization problem is formulated in the primal-dual least squares support vector machine setting where side information can be readily incorporated through regularization terms. The proposed model learns a joint representation of the data set across different domains by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem or linear system of equations in the dual. The approach is naturally equipped with out-of-sample extension property, which plays an important role for model selection. Furthermore, the Nystr{\"o}m approximation technique is used to make the computational issues due to the large size of the matrices involved in the eigendecomposition feasible. The learned latent space of the source domain is fed to a multiclass semisupervised kernel spectral clustering model that can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data points of the source domain in order to classify the data instances of the target domain. Experimental results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches on synthetic and real-life data sets.},

  abstract = {Deep learning methods operate in regimes that defy the traditional statistical mindset. The neural network architectures often contain more parameters than training samples, and are so rich that they can interpolate the observed labels, even if the latter are replaced by pure noise. Despite their huge complexity, the same architectures achieve small generalization error on real data. This phenomenon has been rationalized in terms of a so-called `double descent' curve. As the model complexity increases, the generalization error follows the usual U-shaped curve at the beginning, first decreasing and then peaking around the interpolation threshold (when the model achieves vanishing training error). However, it descends again as model complexity exceeds this threshold. The global minimum of the generalization error is found in this overparametrized regime, often when the number of parameters is much larger than the number of samples. Far from being a peculiar property of deep neural networks, elements of this behavior have been demonstrated in much simpler settings, including linear regression with random covariates. In this paper we consider the problem of learning an unknown function over the \$d\$-dimensional sphere \${\textbackslash}mathbb S{\textasciicircum}\{d-1\}\$, from \$n\$ i.i.d. samples \$({\textbackslash}boldsymbol x\_i, y\_i) {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb S{\textasciicircum}\{d-1\} {\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}mathbb R\$, \$i {\textbackslash}le n\$. We perform ridge regression on \$N\$ random features of the form \${\textbackslash}sigma({\textbackslash}boldsymbol w\_a{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf T\}{\textbackslash}boldsymbol x)\$, \$a {\textbackslash}le N\$. This can be equivalently described as a two-layers neural network with random first-layer weights. We compute the precise asymptotics of the generalization error, in the limit \$N, n, d {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}infty\$ with \$N/d\$ and \$n/d\$ fixed. This provides the first analytically tractable model that captures all the features of the double descent phenomenon without assuming ad hoc misspecification structures.},

The estimates have the attractive property of being invariant under groupwise orthogonal reparameterizations. We extend the group lasso to logistic regression models and present an efficient algorithm, that is especially suitable for high dimensional problems, which can also be applied to generalized linear models to solve the corresponding convex optimization problem. The group lasso estimator for logistic regression is shown to be statistically consistent even if the number of predictors is much larger than sample size but with sparse true underlying structure. We further use a two-stage procedure which aims for sparser models than the group lasso, leading to improved prediction performance for some cases. Moreover, owing to the two-stage nature, the estimates can be constructed to be hierarchical. The methods are used on simulated and real data sets about splice site detection in DNA sequences.},

In this paper, we show that the original architecture of the NARX network can be easily and efficiently applied to long-term (multi-step-ahead) prediction of univariate time series. We evaluate the proposed approach using two real-world data sets, namely the well-known chaotic laser time series and a variable bit rate (VBR) video traffic time series. All the results show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms standard neural network based predictors, such as the TDNN and Elman architectures.},

  abstract = {The unconditional generation of high fidelity images is a longstanding benchmark for testing the performance of image decoders. Autoregressive image models have been able to generate small images unconditionally, but the extension of these methods to large images where fidelity can be more readily assessed has remained an open problem. Among the major challenges are the capacity to encode the vast previous context and the sheer difficulty of learning a distribution that preserves both global semantic coherence and exactness of detail. To address the former challenge, we propose the Subscale Pixel Network (SPN), a conditional decoder architecture that generates an image as a sequence of sub-images of equal size. The SPN compactly captures image-wide spatial dependencies and requires a fraction of the memory and the computation required by other fully autoregressive models. To address the latter challenge, we propose to use Multidimensional Upscaling to grow an image in both size and depth via intermediate stages utilising distinct SPNs. We evaluate SPNs on the unconditional generation of CelebAHQ of size 256 and of ImageNet from size 32 to 256. We achieve state-of-the-art likelihood results in multiple settings, set up new benchmark results in previously unexplored settings and are able to generate very high fidelity large scale samples on the basis of both datasets.},

We have proposed a new paradigm known as occlusion MI vs. nonocclusion MI (OMI vs. NOMI). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the two paradigms within a single population. We hypothesized that STEMI(-) OMI would have characteristics similar to STEMI(+) OMI but longer time to catheterization. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected acute coronary syndrome population. OMI was defined as an acute culprit and either TIMI 0-2 flow or TIMI 3 flow plus peak troponin T~{$>~$}1.0~ng/mL. We collected electrocardiograms, demographic characteristics, laboratory results, angiographic data, and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 467 patients, there were 108 OMIs, with only 60\% (67 of 108) meeting STEMI criteria. Median peak troponin T for the STEMI(+) OMI, STEMI(-) OMI, and no occlusion groups were 3.78 (interquartile range [IQR] 2.18-7.63), 1.87 (IQR 1.12-5.48), and 0.00 (IQR 0.00-0.08). Median time from arrival to catheterization was 41~min (IQR 23-86~min) for STEMI(+) OMI compared with 437~min (IQR 85-1590~min) for STEMI(-) OMI (p~{$<~$}0.001). STEMI(+) OMI was more likely than STEMI(-) OMI to undergo catheterization within 90~min (76\% vs. 28\%; p~{$<~$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: STEMI(-) OMI patients had significant delays to catheterization but adverse outcomes more similar to STEMI(+) OMI than those with no occlusion. These data support the OMI/NOMI paradigm and the importance of further research into emergent reperfusion for STEMI(-) OMI.},

The first is the relationship of the spectral properties of the dynamics on the attractor of the original, high-dimensional dynamical system with the properties and possibilities for model reduction. We review some elements of the spectral theory of dynamical systems. We apply this theory to obtain a decomposition of the process that utilizes spectral properties of the linear Koopman operator associated with the asymptotic dynamics on the attractor. This allows us to extract the almost periodic part of the evolving process. The remainder of the process has continuous spectrum. The second topic we discuss is that of model validation, where the original, possibly high-dimensional dynamics and the dynamics of the reduced model -- that can be deterministic or stochastic -- are compared in some norm. Using the ``statistical Takens theorem'' proven in (Mezi{\'c}, I. and Banaszuk, A. Physica D, 2004) we argue that comparison of average energy contained in the finite-dimensional projection is one in the hierarchy of functionals of the field that need to be checked in order to assess the accuracy of the projection.},

  abstract = {The problem of learning long-term dependencies in sequences using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is still a major challenge. Recent methods have been suggested to solve this problem by constraining the transition matrix to be unitary during training which ensures that its norm is equal to one and prevents exploding gradients. These methods either have limited expressiveness or scale poorly with the size of the network when compared with the simple RNN case, especially when using stochastic gradient descent with a small mini-batch size. Our contributions are as follows; we first show that constraining the transition matrix to be unitary is a special case of an orthogonal constraint. Then we present a new parametrisation of the transition matrix which allows efficient training of an RNN while ensuring that the matrix is always orthogonal. Our results show that the orthogonal constraint on the transition matrix applied through our parametrisation gives similar benefits to the unitary constraint, without the time complexity limitations.},

Taken together, these findings shed light on the effective power of recurrent networks and suggest much of sequence learning happens, or can be made to happen, in the stable regime.

To mitigate this issue, it is commonly believed that more training data will eventually help such adversarially robust models generalize better on the benign/unperturbed test data. In this paper, however, we challenge this conventional belief and show that more training data can hurt the generalization of adversarially robust models in the classification problems. We first investigate the Gaussian mixture classification with a linear loss and identify three regimes based on the strength of the adversary. In the weak adversary regime, more data improves the generalization of adversarially robust models. In the medium adversary regime, with more training data, the generalization loss exhibits a double descent curve, which implies the existence of an intermediate stage where more training data hurts the generalization. In the strong adversary regime, more data almost immediately causes the generalization error to increase. Then we move to the analysis of a two-dimensional classification problem with a 0-1 loss. We prove that more data always hurts the generalization performance of adversarially trained models with large perturbations. To complement our theoretical results, we conduct empirical studies on Gaussian mixture classification, support vector machines (SVMs), and linear regression.},

  abstract = {Traditionally in regression one minimizes the number of fitting parameters or uses smoothing/regularization to trade training (TE) and generalization error (GE). Driving TE to zero by increasing fitting degrees of freedom (dof) is expected to increase GE. However modern big-data approaches, including deep nets, seem to over-parametrize and send TE to zero (data interpolation) without impacting GE. Overparametrization has the benefit that global minima of the empirical loss function proliferate and become easier to find. These phenomena have drawn theoretical attention. Regression and classification algorithms have been shown that interpolate data but also generalize optimally. An interesting related phenomenon has been noted: the existence of non-monotonic risk curves, with a peak in GE with increasing dof. It was suggested that this peak separates a classical regime from a modern regime where over-parametrization improves performance. Similar over-fitting peaks were reported previously (statistical physics approach to learning) and attributed to increased fitting model flexibility. We introduce a generative and fitting model pair ("Misparametrized Sparse Regression" or MiSpaR) and show that the overfitting peak can be dissociated from the point at which the fitting function gains enough dof's to match the data generative model and thus provides good generalization. This complicates the interpretation of overfitting peaks as separating a "classical" from a "modern" regime. Data interpolation itself cannot guarantee good generalization: we need to study the interpolation with different penalty terms. We present analytical formulae for GE curves for MiSpaR with \$l\_2\$ and \$l\_1\$ penalties, in the interpolating limit \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}rightarrow 0\$.These risk curves exhibit important differences and help elucidate the underlying phenomena.},

Unfortunately, finding these "winning ticket" initializations is computationally expensive. One potential solution is to reuse the same winning tickets across a variety of datasets and optimizers. However, the generality of winning ticket initializations remains unclear. Here, we attempt to answer this question by generating winning tickets for one training configuration (optimizer and dataset) and evaluating their performance on another configuration. Perhaps surprisingly, we found that, within the natural images domain, winning ticket initializations generalized across a variety of datasets, including Fashion MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and Places365, often achieving performance close to that of winning tickets generated on the same dataset. Moreover, winning tickets generated using larger datasets consistently transferred better than those generated using smaller datasets. We also found that winning ticket initializations generalize across optimizers with high performance. These results suggest that winning ticket initializations generated by sufficiently large datasets contain inductive biases generic to neural networks more broadly which improve training across many settings and provide hope for the development of better initialization methods.},

We investigate this overparameterized regime in linear regression, where all solutions that minimize training error interpolate the data, including noise. We lower-bound the fundamental generalization (mean-squared) error of any interpolating solution in the presence of noise, and show that this bound decays to zero with the number of features. Thus, overparameterization can be beneficial in ensuring harmless interpolation of noise. We discuss two root causes for poor generalization that are complementary in nature - signal ``bleeding'' into a large number of alias features, and overfitting of noise by parsimonious feature selectors. For the sparse linear model with noise, we provide a hybrid interpolating scheme that mitigates both these issues and achieves order-optimal MSE over all possible interpolating solutions.},

Moreover, we show that double descent occurs not just as a function of model size, but also as a function of the number of training epochs. We unify the above phenomena by defining a new complexity measure we call the effective model complexity and conjecture a generalized double descent with respect to this measure. Furthermore, our notion of model complexity allows us to identify certain regimes where increasing (even quadrupling) the number of train samples actually hurts test performance.},

  abstract = {Training a neural network with the gradient descent algorithm gives rise to a discrete-time nonlinear dynamical system. Consequently, behaviors that are typically observed in these systems emerge during training, such as convergence to an orbit but not to a fixed point or dependence of convergence on the initialization. Step size of the algorithm plays a critical role in these behaviors: it determines the subset of the local optima that the algorithm can converge to, and it specifies the magnitude of the oscillations if the algorithm converges to an orbit. To elucidate the effects of the step size on training of neural networks, we study the gradient descent algorithm as a discrete-time dynamical system, and by analyzing the Lyapunov stability of different solutions, we show the relationship between the step size of the algorithm and the solutions that can be obtained with this algorithm. The results provide an explanation for several phenomena observed in practice, including the deterioration in the training error with increased depth, the hardness of estimating linear mappings with large singular values, and the distinct performance of deep residual networks.},

Improvements in myocardial infarction (MI) care are crucial for reducing premature mortality. We aimed to evaluate the main challenges for adequate MI care in LMIC, and possible strategies to overcome these existing barriers.Reperfusion is the cornerstone of MI treatment, but worldwide around 30\% of patients are not reperfused, with even lower rates in LMIC. The main challenges are related to delays associated with patient education, late diagnosis and inadequate referral strategies, health infrastructure and insufficient funding. The implementation of regional MI systems of care in LMIC, systematising timely reperfusion strategies, access to intensive care, risk stratification and use of adjunctive medications have shown some successful strategies. Telemedicine support for remote ECG, diagnosis and organisation of referrals has proven to be useful, improving access to reperfusion even in prehospital settings. Organisation of transport and referral hubs based on anticipated delays and development of MI excellence centres have also resulted in better equality of care. Also, education of healthcare staff and task shifting may potentially widen access to optimal therapy.In conclusion, efforts have been made for the implementation of MI systems of care in LMIC, aiming to address particularities of the health systems. However, the increasing impact of MI in these countries urges the development of further strategies to improve reperfusion and reduce system delays.}

A grey-box, or semi-physical, nonlinear state-space representation is introduced, expressing the nonlinear basis functions using a limited number of measured output variables.

A two-step identification procedure is derived for the grey-box model parameters, integrating nonlinear subspace initialisation and weighted least-squares optimisation. The complete procedure is applied to an electrical circuit mimicking the behaviour of a single--input, single--output (SISO) nonlinear mechanical system and to a single--input, multiple--output (SIMO) geometrically nonlinear beam structure.},

Ten years ago, an MSSP paper reviewing the progress achieved until then [1] concluded that the identification of simple continuous structures with localised nonlinearities was within reach. The past decade witnessed a shift in emphasis, accommodating the growing industrial need for a first generation of tools capable of addressing complex nonlinearities in larger-scale structures. The objective of the present paper is to survey the key developments which arose in the field since 2006, and to illustrate state-of-the-art techniques using a real-world satellite structure. Finally, a broader perspective to nonlinear system identification is provided by discussing the central role played by experimental models in the design cycle of engineering structures.},

Methods For this non-randomised interventional trial, we prospectively recruited patients with stroke risk factors but with no known atrial fibrillation who had an electrocardiogram (ECG) done in routine practice. Participants wore a continuous ambulatory heart rhythm monitor for up to 30 days, with the data transmitted in near real time through a cellular connection. The AI algorithm was applied to the ECGs to divide patients into high-risk or low-risk groups. The primary outcome was newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. In a secondary analysis, trial participants were propensity-score matched (1:1) to individuals from the eligible but unenrolled population who served as real-world controls. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04208971. Findings 1003 patients with a mean age of 74 years (SD 8{$\cdot$}8) from 40 US states completed the study. Over a mean 22{$\cdot$}3 days of continuous monitoring, atrial fibrillation was detected in six (1{$\cdot$}6\%) of 370 patients with low risk and 48 (7{$\cdot$}6\%) of 633 with high risk (odds ratio 4{$\cdot$}98, 95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}11--11{$\cdot$}75, p=0{$\cdot$}0002). Compared with usual care, AI-guided screening was associated with increased detection of atrial fibrillation (high-risk group: 3{$\cdot$}6\% [95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}3--5{$\cdot$}4] with usual care vs 10{$\cdot$}6\% [8{$\cdot$}3--13{$\cdot$}2] with AI-guided screening, p{\textexclamdown}0{$\cdot$}0001; low-risk group: 0{$\cdot$}9\% vs 2{$\cdot$}4\%, p=0{$\cdot$}12) over a median follow-up of 9{$\cdot$}9 months (IQR 7{$\cdot$}1--11{$\cdot$}0). Interpretation An AI-guided targeted screening approach that leverages existing clinical data increased the yield for atrial fibrillation detection and could improve the effectiveness of atrial fibrillation screening.

  abstract = {There is a previously identified equivalence between wide fully connected neural networks (FCNs) and Gaussian processes (GPs). This equivalence enables, for instance, test set predictions that would have resulted from a fully Bayesian, infinitely wide trained FCN to be computed without ever instantiating the FCN, but by instead evaluating the corresponding GP. In this work, we derive an analogous equivalence for multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) both with and without pooling layers, and achieve state of the art results on CIFAR10 for GPs without trainable kernels. We also introduce a Monte Carlo method to estimate the GP corresponding to a given neural network architecture, even in cases where the analytic form has too many terms to be computationally feasible. Surprisingly, in the absence of pooling layers, the GPs corresponding to CNNs with and without weight sharing are identical. As a consequence, translation equivariance in finite-channel CNNs trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has no corresponding property in the Bayesian treatment of the infinite channel limit - a qualitative difference between the two regimes that is not present in the FCN case. We confirm experimentally, that while in some scenarios the performance of SGD-trained finite CNNs approaches that of the corresponding GPs as the channel count increases, with careful tuning SGD-trained CNNs can significantly outperform their corresponding GPs, suggesting advantages from SGD training compared to fully Bayesian parameter estimation.},

In the infinite width limit, the NTK can sometimes be computed analytically and is useful for understanding training and generalization of NN architectures. At finite widths, the NTK is also used to better initialize NNs, compare the conditioning across models, perform architecture search, and do meta-learning. Unfortunately, the finite width NTK is notoriously expensive to compute, which severely limits its practical utility. We perform the first in-depth analysis of the compute and memory requirements for NTK computation in finite width networks. Leveraging the structure of neural networks, we further propose two novel algorithms that change the exponent of the compute and memory requirements of the finite width NTK, dramatically improving efficiency. Our algorithms can be applied in a black box fashion to any differentiable function, including those implementing neural networks. We open-source our implementations within the Neural Tangents package (arXiv:1912.02803) at https://github.com/google/neural-tangents.},

  abstract = {Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) enables the measurement of DNA copy number across thousands of locations in a genome. The main goals of analyzing aCGH data are to identify the regions of copy number variation (CNV) and to quantify the amount of CNV. Although there are many methods for analyzing single-sample aCGH data, the analysis of multi-sample aCGH data is a relatively new area of research. Further, many of the current approaches for analyzing multi-sample aCGH data do not appropriately utilize the additional information present in the multiple samples. We propose a procedure called the Fused Lasso Latent Feature Model (FLLat) that provides a statistical framework for modeling multi-sample aCGH data and identifying regions of CNV. The procedure involves modeling each sample of aCGH data as a weighted sum of a fixed number of features. Regions of CNV are then identified through an application of the fused lasso penalty to each feature. Some simulation analyses show that FLLat outperforms single-sample methods when the simulated samples share common information. We also propose a method for estimating the false discovery rate. An analysis of an aCGH data set obtained from human breast tumors, focusing on chromosomes 8 and 17, shows that FLLat and Significance Testing of Aberrant Copy number (an alternative, existing approach) identify similar regions of CNV that are consistent with previous findings. However, through the estimated features and their corresponding weights, FLLat is further able to discern specific relationships between the samples, for example, identifying 3 distinct groups of samples based on their patterns of CNV for chromosome 17.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are few contemporary cohorts of Trypanosoma cruzi-seropositive individuals, and the basic clinical epidemiology of Chagas disease is poorly understood. Herein, we report the incidence of cardiomyopathy and death associated with T. cruzi seropositivity. METHODS: Participants were selected in blood banks at 2 Brazilian centers. Cases were defined as T. cruzi-seropositive blood donors. T. cruzi-seronegative controls were matched for age, sex, and period of donation. Patients with established Chagas cardiomyopathy were recruited from a tertiary outpatient service. Participants underwent medical examination, blood collection, ECG, and echocardiogram at enrollment (2008-2010) and at follow-up (2018-2019). The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and development of cardiomyopathy, defined as the presence of a left ventricular ejection fraction {$<$}50\% or QRS complex duration {$\geq$}120 ms, or both. To handle loss to follow-up, a sensitivity analysis was performed using inverse probability weights for selection. RESULTS: We enrolled 499 T. cruzi-seropositive donors (age 48{\textpm}10 years, 52\% male), 488 T. cruzi-seronegative donors (age 49{\textpm}10 years, 49\% male), and 101 patients with established Chagas cardiomyopathy (age 48{\textpm}8 years, 59\% male). The mortality in patients with established cardiomyopathy was 80.9 deaths/1000 person-years (py) (54/101, 53\%) and 15.1 deaths/1000 py (17/114, 15\%) in T. cruzi-seropositive donors with cardiomyopathy at baseline. Among T. cruzi-seropositive donors without cardiomyopathy at baseline, mortality was 3.7 events/1000 py (15/385, 4\%), which was no different from T. cruzi-seronegative donors with 3.6 deaths/1000 py (17/488, 3\%). The incidence of cardiomyopathy in T. cruzi-seropositive donors was 13.8 (95\% CI, 9.5-19.6) events/1000 py (32/262, 12\%) compared with 4.6 (95\% CI, 2.3-8.3) events/1000 py (11/277, 4\%) in seronegative controls, with an absolute incidence difference associated with T. cruzi seropositivity of 9.2 (95\% CI, 3.6-15.0) events/1000 py. T. cruzi antibody level at baseline was associated with development of cardiomyopathy (adjusted odds ratio, 1.4 [95\% CI, 1.1-1.8]). CONCLUSIONS: We present a comprehensive description of the natural history of T. cruzi seropositivity in a contemporary patient population. The results highlight the central importance of anti-T. cruzi antibody titer as a marker of Chagas disease activity and risk of progression.},

Our method focuses exclusively on automated ECG diagnosis and analyzes the explanation in terms of clinical accuracy for interpretability and robustness. The proposed method uses a noise-insertion strategy to quantify the impact of intervals and segments of the ECG signals on the automated classification outcome. An ECG segmentation method was applied to ECG tracings, to obtain: (1) Intervals, Segments and Axis; (2) Rate, and (3) Rhythm. Noise was added to the signal to disturb the ECG features in a realistic way. The method was tested using Monte Carlo simulation and the feature impact is estimated by the change in the model prediction averaged over 499 executions and a feature is defined as important if its mean value changes the result of the classifier. We demonstrate our method by explaining diagnoses generated by a deep convolutional neural network. The proposed method is particularly effective and useful for modern deep learning models that take raw data as input.},

After creating a unified reimplementation of various widely-used SSL techniques, we test them in a suite of experiments designed to address these issues. We find that the performance of simple baselines which do not use unlabeled data is often underreported, that SSL methods differ in sensitivity to the amount of labeled and unlabeled data, and that performance can degrade substantially when the unlabeled dataset contains out-of-class examples. To help guide SSL research towards real-world applicability, we make our unified reimplemention and evaluation platform publicly available.},

When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity.

  abstract = {Compressive sensing has emerged as an area that opens new perspectives in signal acquisition and processing. It appears as an alternative to the traditional sampling theory, endeavoring to reduce the required number of samples for successful signal reconstruction. In practice, compressive sensing aims to provide saving in sensing resources, transmission, and storage capacities and to facilitate signal processing in the circumstances when certain data are unavailable. To that end, compressive sensing relies on the mathematical algorithms solving the problem of data reconstruction from a greatly reduced number of measurements by exploring the properties of sparsity and incoherence. Therefore, this concept includes the optimization procedures aiming to provide the sparsest solution in a suitable representation domain. This work, therefore, offers a survey of the compressive sensing idea and prerequisites, together with the commonly used reconstruction methods. Moreover, the compressive sensing problem formulation is considered in signal processing applications assuming some of the commonly used transformation domains, namely, the Fourier transform domain, the polynomial Fourier transform domain, Hermite transform domain, and combined time-frequency domain.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of inferring the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome across space, using observational data. The data is possibly subject to unmeasured confounding variables which, in a standard approach, must be adjusted for by estimating a nuisance function. Here we develop a method that eliminates the nuisance function, while mitigating the resulting errors-in-variables. The result is a robust and accurate inference method for spatially varying heterogeneous causal effects. The properties of the method are demonstrated on synthetic as well as real data from Germany and the US.},

  abstract = {The title Lasso has been suggested by Tibshirani (1996) as a colourful name for a technique of variable selection which requires the minimization of a sum of squares subject to an l1 bound {$\kappa$} on the solution. This forces zero components in the minimizing solution for small values of {$\kappa$}. Thus this bound can function as a selection parameter. This paper makes two contributions to computational problems associated with implementing the Lasso: (1) a compact descent method for solving the constrained problem for a particular value of {$\kappa$} is formulated, and (2) a homotopy method, in which the constraint bound {$\kappa$} becomes the homotopy parameter, is developed to completely describe the possible selection regimes. Both algorithms have a finite termination property. It is suggested that modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization applied to an augmented design matrix provides an effective basis for implementing the algorithms.},

  abstract = {Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at following a user's intent. For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through a language model API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.}

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a public health problem with increasing prevalence as the population ages, associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.Hypothesis: Evaluate the association between the presence of AF with overall and cardiovascular mortality in a large electronic cohort of primary care patients of Minas Gerais.Methods: This is an observational retrospective study. Patients over 16 years old who performed digital electrocardiograms by Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais from 2013 to 2016 were assessed. A probabilistic linkage between data from the national mortality information system and our ECG database was made. Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted by a team of trained cardiologists and automatic software (Glasgow and Minnesota).The diagnosis of AF was considered if there was concordance between the cardiologist{$\prime$}s report and one of the automatic systems. In cases of disagreement, ECGs were reviewed manually.Only the first ECG made was analysed. To assess the relation between AF and mortality, Cox regression was used, adjusted by age, sex and clinical conditions.Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,075,531 were included. The mean age was 51.4 years, 40.5\% male.The prevalence of AF was 1.15\%. There were 2.9\% deaths for all causes in 2.69 years of mean follow up. In univariate analysis, AF was a risk factor for death from all causes (HR 6.98, 95\%CI 6.68-7.28). After adjustment for age, sex and comorbidities, AF remained an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR 2.49; 95\% CI 2.39 - 2.61). AF was also a predictor of risk for cardiovascular mortality after adjustment for age, sex and clinical conditions (HR 2.35, 95\% CI 2.01-2.73). In multivariate analysis by sex, adjusted for age and comorbidities, AF women had higher risk of death for all causes (HR 3.06; 95\% CI 2.86-3.26) than men (HR 2.18; 95\% CI 2.06-2.32). There were no difference between sex in cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.34; 95\% CI 2.01-2.73 for male sex e HR 2.49; 95\% CI 2.14-2.90 for female).Conclusions: AF was a strong predictor of mortality for all causes and cardiovascular mortality in primary care population with increased risk in women for deaths for all cause.},

The present study describes the development and clinical applications of an electronic cohort derived from a digital ECG database obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, for the period 2010--2017, linked to the mortality data from the national information system, the Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiography (CODE) dataset. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. A total of 1,666,778 (94\%) underwent a valid ECG recording for the period 2010 to 2017, with 1,558,421 patients over 16 years old; 40.2\% were men, with a mean age of 51.7 [SD 17.6] years. During a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the mortality rate was 3.3\%. ECG abnormalities assessed were: atrial fibrillation (AF), right bundle branch block (RBBB), left bundle branch block (LBBB), atrioventricular block (AVB), and ventricular pre-excitation. Most ECG abnormalities (AF: Hazard ratio [HR] 2.10; 95\% CI 2.03--2.17; RBBB: HR 1.32; 95\%CI 1.27--1.36; LBBB: HR 1.69; 95\% CI 1.62--1.76; first degree AVB: Relative survival [RS]: 0.76; 95\% CI0.71--0.81; 2:1 AVB: RS 0.21 95\% CI0.09--0.52; and RS 0.36; third degree AVB: 95\% CI 0.26--0.49) were predictors of overall mortality, except for ventricular pre-excitation (HR 1.41; 95\% CI 0.56--3.57) and Mobitz I AVB (RS 0.65; 95\% CI 0.34--1.24). In conclusion, a large ECG database established by a telehealth network can be a useful tool for facilitating new advances in the fields of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology.},

We draw on many techniques from variational spline theory and so we propose the notion of polynomial ridge splines, which correspond to single-hidden layer neural networks with truncated power functions as the activation function. The representer theorem is reminiscent of the classical reproducing kernel Hilbert space representer theorem, but we show that the neural network problem is posed over a non-Hilbertian Banach space. While the learning problems are posed in the continuous-domain, similar to kernel methods, the problems can be recast as finite-dimensional neural network training problems. These neural network training problems have regularizers which are related to the well-known weight decay and path-norm regularizers. Thus, our result gives insight into functional characteristics of trained neural networks and also into the design neural network regularizers. We also show that these regularizers promote neural network solutions with desirable generalization properties.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of estimating an unknown function from noisy data using shallow (single-hidden layer) ReLU neural networks. The estimators we study minimize the sum of squared data-fitting errors plus a regularization term proportional to the Euclidean norm of the network weights. This minimization corresponds to the common approach of training a neural network with weight decay. We quantify the performance (mean-squared error) of these neural network estimators when the data-generating function belongs to the space of functions of second-order bounded variation in the Radon domain. This space of functions was recently proposed as the natural function space associated with shallow ReLU neural networks. We derive a minimax lower bound for the estimation problem for this function space and show that the neural network estimators are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. We also show that this is a "mixed variation" function space that contains classical multivariate function spaces including certain Sobolev spaces and certain spectral Barron spaces. Finally, we use these results to quantify a gap between neural networks and linear methods (which include kernel methods). This paper sheds light on the phenomenon that neural networks seem to break the curse of dimensionality.},

  abstract = {A wide variety of activation functions have been proposed for neural networks. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is especially popular today. There are many practical reasons that motivate the use of the ReLU. This paper provides new theoretical characterizations that support the use of the ReLU, its variants such as the leaky ReLU, as well as other activation functions in the case of univariate, single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks. Our results also explain the importance of commonly used strategies in the design and training of neural networks such as "weight decay" and "path-norm" regularization, and provide a new justification for the use of "skip connections" in network architectures. These new insights are obtained through the lens of spline theory. In particular, we show how neural network training problems are related to infinite-dimensional optimizations posed over Banach spaces of functions whose solutions are well-known to be fractional and polynomial splines, where the particular Banach space (which controls the order of the spline) depends on the choice of activation function.},

This was motivated by successful applications of feedforward networks with nonsigmoidal hidden-layer units. This paper reports on a related study of radial-basis-function (RBF) networks, and it is proved that RBF networks having one hidden layer are capable of universal approximation. Here the emphasis is on the case of typical RBF networks, and the results show that a certain class of RBF networks with the same smoothing factor in each kernel node is broad enough for universal approximation.},

The matrices resemble the product analogs of the sample covariance matrices, however, an important difference is that the population covariance matrices, which are assumed to be non-random in the standard setting of statistics and random matrix theory, are now random, moreover, are certain functions of random data matrices. The problem has been considered in recent work [21] by using the techniques of free probability theory. Since, however, free probability theory deals with population matrices which are independent of the data matrices, its applicability in this case requires an additional justification. We present this justification by using a version of the standard techniques of random matrix theory under the assumption that the entries of data matrices are independent Gaussian random variables. In the subsequent paper [18] we extend our results to the case where the entries of data matrices are just independent identically distributed random variables with several finite moments. This, in particular, extends the property of the so-called macroscopic universality on the considered random matrices.},

To this end, we leverage powerful tools from free probability theory to provide a detailed analytic understanding of how a deep network's Jacobian spectrum depends on various hyperparameters including the nonlinearity, the weight and bias distributions, and the depth. For a variety of nonlinearities, our work reveals the emergence of new universal limiting spectral distributions that remain concentrated around one even as the depth goes to infinity.},

Performativity is a well-studied phenomenon in policy-making that has so far been neglected in supervised learning. When ignored, performativity surfaces as undesirable distribution shift, routinely addressed with retraining. We develop a risk minimization framework for performative prediction bringing together concepts from statistics, game theory, and causality. A conceptual novelty is an equilibrium notion we call performative stability. Performative stability implies that the predictions are calibrated not against past outcomes, but against the future outcomes that manifest from acting on the prediction. Our main results are necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of retraining to a performatively stable point of nearly minimal loss. In full generality, performative prediction strictly subsumes the setting known as strategic classification. We thus also give the first sufficient conditions for retraining to overcome strategic feedback effects.},

Here we link proteomic profiles to CRF in 14,145 individuals across four international cohorts with diverse CRF ascertainment methods to establish, validate and characterize a proteomic CRF score. In a cohort of around 22,000 individuals in the UK Biobank, a proteomic CRF score was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.50 (95\% confidence interval 0.48--0.52) per 1\,s.d. increase). The proteomic CRF score was also associated with multisystem disease risk and provided risk reclassification and discrimination beyond clinical risk factors, as well as modulating high polygenic risk of certain diseases. Finally, we observed dynamicity of the proteomic CRF score in individuals who undertook a 20-week exercise training program and an association of the score with the degree of the effect of training on CRF, suggesting potential use of the score for personalization of exercise recommendations. These results indicate that population-based proteomics provides biologically relevant molecular readouts of CRF that are additive to genetic risk, potentially modifiable and clinically translatable.},

Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.},

In particular, maximum likelihood and prediction error methods represent the mainstream approaches to identification of linear dynamic systems, with a long history of theoretical and algorithmic contributions. Parallel to this, in the machine learning community alternative techniques have been developed. Until recently, there has been little contact between these two worlds. The first aim of this survey is to make accessible to the control community the key mathematical tools and concepts as well as the computational aspects underpinning these learning techniques. In particular, we focus on kernel-based regularization and its connections with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and Bayesian estimation of Gaussian processes. The second aim is to demonstrate that learning techniques tailored to the specific features of dynamic systems may outperform conventional parametric approaches for identification of stable linear systems.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with higher risk of stroke. While the prevalence of AF is low in the general population, risk prediction models might identify individuals for selective screening of AF. We aimed to systematically identify and compare the utility of established models to predict prevalent AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE for risk prediction models for AF. We adapted established risk prediction models and assessed their predictive performance using data from 2.5M individuals who attended vascular screening clinics in the USA and the UK and in the subset of 1.2M individuals with CHA2DS2-VASc {$\geq$}2. We assessed discrimination using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves and agreement between observed and predicted cases using calibration plots. After screening 6959 studies, 14 risk prediction models were identified. In our cohort, 10~464 (0.41\%) participants had AF. For discrimination, six prediction model had AUROC curves of 0.70 or above in all individuals and those with CHA2DS2-VASc {$\geq$}2. In these models, calibration plots showed very good concordance between predicted and observed risks of AF. The two models with the highest observed prevalence in the highest decile of predicted risk, CHARGE-AF and MHS, showed an observed prevalence of AF of 1.6\% with a number needed to screen of 63. Selective screening of the 10\% highest risk identified 39\% of cases with AF. CONCLUSION: Prediction models can reliably identify individuals at high risk of AF. The best performing models showed an almost fourfold higher prevalence of AF by selective screening of individuals in the highest decile of risk compared with systematic screening of all cases.

  abstract = {Concentration of measure has been argued to be the fundamental cause of adversarial vulnerability. Mahloujifar et al. presented an empirical way to measure the concentration of a data distribution using samples, and employed it to find lower bounds on intrinsic robustness for several benchmark datasets. However, it remains unclear whether these lower bounds are tight enough to provide a useful approximation for the intrinsic robustness of a dataset. To gain a deeper understanding of the concentration of measure phenomenon, we first extend the Gaussian Isoperimetric Inequality to non-spherical Gaussian measures and arbitrary \${\textbackslash}ell\_p\$-norms (\$p {\textbackslash}geq 2\$). We leverage these theoretical insights to design a method that uses half-spaces to estimate the concentration of any empirical dataset under \${\textbackslash}ell\_p\$-norm distance metrics. Our proposed algorithm is more efficient than Mahloujifar et al.'s, and our experiments on synthetic datasets and image benchmarks demonstrate that it is able to find much tighter intrinsic robustness bounds. These tighter estimates provide further evidence that rules out intrinsic dataset concentration as a possible explanation for the adversarial vulnerability of state-of-the-art classifiers.},

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described},

In this manuscript we investigate an implementation of Discrete local Sensitivity Analysis via Automatic Differentiation (DSAAD). A non-stiff Lotka-Volterra model, a discretization of the two dimensional (\$N {\textbackslash}times N\$) Brusselator stiff reaction-diffusion PDE, a stiff non-linear air pollution and a non-stiff pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model were used as prototype models for this investigation. Our benchmarks show that on sufficiently small ({$<$}100 parameters) stiff and non-stiff systems of ODEs, forward-mode DSAAD is more efficient than both reverse-mode DSAAD and continuous forward/adjoint sensitivity analysis. The scalability of continuous adjoint methods is shown to result in better efficiency for larger ODE systems such as PDE discretizations. In addition to testing efficiency, results on test equations demonstrate the applicability of DSAAD to differential-algebraic equations, delay differential equations, and hybrid differential equation systems where the event timing and effects are dependent on model parameters. Together, these results show that language-level automatic differentiation is an efficient method for calculating local sensitivities of a wide range of differential equation models.},

  abstract = {Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classification. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these specific tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative fine-tuning on each specific task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during fine-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures specifically crafted for each task, significantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied.

  abstract = {Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classification. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these specific tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative fine-tuning on each specific task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during fine-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures specifically crafted for each task, significantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9\% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7\% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5\% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).},

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on taskspecific datasets. We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText. Samples from the model reflect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These findings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.},

  abstract = {SOTA computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study performance on over 30 different computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers nontrivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.},

  author = {Raj, Anant},
  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that heavy tails can emerge in stochastic optimization and that the heaviness of the tails have links to the generalization error. While these studies have shed light on interesting aspects of the generalization behavior in modern settings, they relied on strong topological and statistical regularity assumptions, which are hard to verify in practice. Furthermore, it has been empirically illustrated that the relation between heavy tails and generalization might not always be monotonic in practice, contrary to the conclusions of existing theory. In this study, we establish novel links between the tail behavior and generalization properties of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), through the lens of algorithmic stability. We consider a quadratic optimization problem and use a heavy-tailed stochastic differential equation (and its Euler discretization) as a proxy for modeling the heavy-tailed behavior emerging in SGD. We then prove uniform stability bounds, which reveal the following outcomes: (i) Without making any exotic assumptions, we show that SGD will not be stable if the stability is measured with the squared-loss x {$\rightarrow$} x2, whereas it in turn becomes stable if the stability is instead measured with a surrogate loss x {$\rightarrow$} {\textbar}x{\textbar}p with some p {$<$} 2. (ii) Depending on the variance of the data, there exists a `threshold of heavy-tailedness' such that the generalization error decreases as the tails become heavier, as long as the tails are lighter than this threshold. This suggests that the relation between heavy tails and generalization is not globally monotonic. (iii) We prove matching lower-bounds on uniform stability, implying that our bounds are tight in terms of the heaviness of the tails. We support our theory with synthetic and real neural network experiments.},

Signals can have sparse or compressible representation either in original domain or in some transform domain. Relying on the sparsity of the signals, CS allows us to sample the signal at a rate much below the Nyquist sampling rate. Also, the varied reconstruction algorithms of CS can faithfully reconstruct the original signal back from fewer compressive measurements. This fact has stimulated research interest toward the use of CS in several fields, such as magnetic resonance imaging, high-speed video acquisition, and ultrawideband communication. This paper reviews the basic theoretical concepts underlying CS. To bridge the gap between theory and practicality of CS, different CS acquisition strategies and reconstruction approaches are elaborated systematically in this paper. The major application areas where CS is currently being used are reviewed here. This paper also highlights some of the challenges and research directions in this field.},

First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. But YOLO can detect more than just 200 classes; it predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories. And it still runs in real-time.},

The standard retraining technique, fine-tuning, trains the unpruned weights from their final trained values using a small fixed learning rate. In this paper, we compare fine-tuning to alternative retraining techniques. Weight rewinding (as proposed by Frankle et al., (2019)), rewinds unpruned weights to their values from earlier in training and retrains them from there using the original training schedule. Learning rate rewinding (which we propose) trains the unpruned weights from their final values using the same learning rate schedule as weight rewinding. Both rewinding techniques outperform fine-tuning, forming the basis of a network-agnostic pruning algorithm that matches the accuracy and compression ratios of several more network-specific state-of-the-art techniques.},

Using the database of a large telehealth network, we built a novel dataset with more than 2 million ECG tracings, orders of magnitude larger than those used in previous studies. Moreover, our dataset is more realistic, as it consist of 12-lead ECGs recorded during standard in-clinics exams. Using this data, we trained a residual neural network with 9 convolutional layers to map 7 to 10 second ECG signals to 6 classes of ECG abnormalities. Future work should extend these results to cover a large range of ECG abnormalities, which could improve the accessibility of this diagnostic tool and avoid wrong diagnosis from medical doctors.},

Deep neural networks are models composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples. Inspired by the success of these models in computer vision, we propose an end-to-end approach for the task at hand. We trained deep convolutional neural network models in the heterogeneous dataset provided in the Physionet 2020 Challenge and used an ensemble of seven of these convolutional models for the classification of abnormalities present in the ECG records. Ensembles use the output of multiple models to generate a combined prediction and are known to improve performance and generalization when compared to the individual models. In our submission, we use an ensemble of neural networks with the architecture similar to the one described in Nat Commun 11, 1760 (2020) for 12-lead ECGs classification. On the partially hidden test dataset from the challenge, the best-scored entry for our team (the ``Code Team'') had a performance of 0.657, which place us in the 7-th place team-wise in the challenge leaderboard.},

Its project was based on v200, a commercial camera produced by Invent Vision (iVision), company for which this prototype was developed. The major steps needed to estimate depth using a stereo camera were followed. They are: calibration (estimation of camera geometry and parameters), retification (aligning images), correspondence (finding correspondent points on the two images and the distance between them) and reconstruction (estimation of features depth using triangulation). All algorithms needed were implemented using C++ and integrated to the prototype. The prototype is able to estimate depth in a range of 0.7 to 20 meters, it has a resolution on the order of a few centimeters and can reach a frame rate of 5 frames per second. The industrial camera v200 has all its internal processing computed by a FPGA. It is suggested, as a future work, to use the FPGA to speed up the retification and correspondence algorithms. The aim of this work was to take a first step towards a stereo camera based on v200 to be a competitive commercial product, apt to be sold by iVision.},

Adversarial attacks are a popular framework for studying these vulnerabilities. In this work, we study the error of linear regression in the face of adversarial attacks. We provide bounds of the error in terms of the traditional risk and the parameter norm and show how these bounds can be leveraged and make it possible to use analysis from non-adversarial setups to study the adversarial risk. The usefulness of these results is illustrated by shedding light on whether or not overparameterized linear models can be adversarially robust. We show that adding features to linear models might be either a source of additional robustness or brittleness. We show that these differences appear due to scaling and how the \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ and \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$ norms of random projections concentrate. We also show how the reformulation we propose allows for solving adversarial training as a convex optimization problem. This is then used as a tool to study how adversarial training and other regularization methods might affect the robustness of the estimated models.},

A numerical example illustrate that each method provides better results when the noise model they implicit consider are consistent with the error in the data. Furthermore, it is argued that for feedforward networks with bounded activation functions the possible lack of stability does not jeopardize the training; and, a novel complexity analysis indicates the computational cost in the two configurations is not significantly different.

Influenced by early arguments, several papers justify the choice of series-parallel rather than parallel configuration claiming it has a lower computational cost, better stability properties during training and provides more accurate results. Other published results, on the other hand, defend parallel training as being more robust and capable of yielding more accurate long-term predictions. The main contribution of this paper is to present a study comparing both methods under the same unified framework with special attention to three aspects: (i)~robustness of the estimation in the presence of noise; (ii)~computational cost; and, (iii)~convergence. A unifying mathematical framework and simulation studies show situations where each training method provides superior validation results and suggest that parallel training is generally better in more realistic scenarios. An example using measured data seems to reinforce such a claim. Complexity analysis and numerical examples show that both methods have similar computational cost although series-parallel training is more amenable to parallelization. Some informal discussion about stability and convergence properties is presented and explored in the examples.},

We show that for regions of the parameter space where the model is not contractive, the Lipschitz constant and beta-smoothness of the objective function might blow up exponentially with the simulation length, making it hard to numerically find minima within those regions or, even, to escape from them. In addition to providing theoretical understanding of this problem, this paper also proposes the use of multiple shooting as a viable solution. The proposed method minimizes the error between a prediction model and the observed values. Rather than running the prediction model over the entire dataset, multiple shooting splits the data into smaller subsets and runs the prediction model over each subset, making the simulation length a design parameter and making it possible to solve problems that would be infeasible using a standard approach. The equivalence to the original problem is obtained by including constraints in the optimization. The new method is illustrated by estimating the parameters of nonlinear systems with chaotic or unstable behavior, as well as neural networks. We also present a comparative analysis of the proposed method with multi-step-ahead prediction error minimization.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art machine learning models can be vulnerable to very small input perturbations that are adversarially constructed. Adversarial training is one of the most effective approaches to defend against such examples. We show that for linear regression problems, adversarial training can be formulated as a convex problem. This fact is then used to show that \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-adversarial training produces sparse solutions and has many similarities to the lasso method. Similarly, \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$-adversarial training has similarities with ridge regression. We use a robust regression framework to analyze and understand these similarities and also point to some differences. Finally, we show how adversarial training behaves differently from other regularization methods when estimating overparameterized models (i.e., models with more parameters than datapoints). It minimizes a sum of three terms which regularizes the solution, but unlike lasso and ridge regression, it can sharply transition into an interpolation mode. We show that for sufficiently many features or sufficiently small regularization parameters, the learned model perfectly interpolates the training data while still exhibiting good out-of-sample performance.},

The present study describes the development and clinical applications of a large database of such digital ECGs, namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. ECGs obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2010 to 17, were organized in a structured database. A hierarchical free-text machine learning algorithm recognized specific ECG diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow ECG Analysis Program provided Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic statements. The presence of a specific ECG abnormality was considered when both automatic and medical diagnosis were concordant; cases of discordance were decided using heuristisc rules and manual review. The ECG database was linked to the national mortality information system using probabilistic linkage methods. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. After excluding the ECGs with technical problems and patients {$<$}16\,years-old, 1,558,415 patients were studied. High performance measures were obtained using an end-to-end deep neural network trained to detect 6 types of ECG abnormalities, with F1 scores {$>$}80\% and specificity {$>$}99\% in an independent test dataset. We also evaluated the risk of mortality associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all causes, with increased risk in women. In conclusion, a large database that comprises all ECGs performed by a large telehealth network can be useful for further developments in the field of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology.},

  abstract = {Methods of transfer learning try to combine knowledge from several related tasks (or domains) to improve performance on a test task. Inspired by causal methodology, we relax the usual covariate shift assumption and assume that it holds true for a subset of predictor variables: the conditional distribution of the target variable given this subset of predictors is invariant over all tasks. We show how this assumption can be motivated from ideas in the field of causality. We focus on the problem of Domain Generalization, in which no examples from the test task are observed. We prove that in an adversarial setting using this subset for prediction is optimal in Domain Generalization; we further provide examples, in which the tasks are sufficiently diverse and the estimator therefore outperforms pooling the data, even on average. If examples from the test task are available, we also provide a method to transfer knowledge from the training tasks and exploit all available features for prediction. However, we provide no guarantees for this method. We introduce a practical method which allows for automatic inference of the above subset and provide corresponding code. We present results on synthetic data sets and a gene deletion data set.},

This paper presents a generalization of these algorithms to a wider class of problems. It is shown that the approach can be applied to the nonparametric system identification method, Direct Weight Optimization (DWO), and be used to enhance the computational efficiency of this method. The most important design parameter in the DWO method is a parameter ({$\lambda$}) controlling the bias-variance trade-off, and the use of parametric optimization with piecewise linear solution paths means that the DWO estimates can be efficiently computed for all values of {$\lambda$} simultaneously. This allows for designing computationally attractive adaptive bandwidth selection algorithms. One such algorithm for DWO is proposed and demonstrated in two examples.},

Therefore, the goal in system identification is to find the good balance between the accuracy, complexity and computational cost of such identification models. In a previous work (Romero-Ugalde et al., 2013 [1]), we focused on the topic of providing balanced accuracy/complexity models by proposing a dedicated neural network design and a model complexity reduction approach. In this paper, we focus on the reduction of the computational cost required to achieve these balanced models. More precisely, the improvement of the preceding method presented here leads to a significantly computational cost reduction of the neural network training phase. Even if this reduction is achieved by a convenient choice of the activation functions and the initial conditions of the synaptic weights, the proposed architecture leads to a wide range of models among the most encountered in the literature assuring the interest of such a method. To validate the proposed approach, two different systems are identified. The first one corresponds to the unavoidable Wiener--Hammerstein system proposed in SYSID2009 as a benchmark. The second system is a flexible robot arm. Results show the interest of the proposed reduction methods.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

  abstract = {Wavelet pooling methods can improve the classification accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Combining wavelet pooling with the Nesterov-accelerated Adam (NAdam) gradient calculation method can improve both the accuracy of the CNN. We have implemented wavelet pooling with NAdam in this work using both a Haar wavelet (WavPool-NH ) and a Shannon wavelet (WavPool-NS ). The WavPool-NH and WavPoolNS methods are most accurate of the methods we considered for the MNIST and LIDCIDRI lung tumor data-sets. The WavPool-NH and WavPool-NS implementations have an accuracy of 95.92\% and 95.52\%, respectively, on the LIDC-IDRI data-set. This is an improvement from the 92.93\% accuracy obtained on this data-set with the max pooling method. The WavPool methods also avoid overfitting which is a concern with max pooling. We also found WavPool performed fairly well on the CIFAR-10 data-set, however, overfitting was an issue with all the methods we considered. Wavelet pooling, especially when combined with an adaptive gradient and wavelets chosen specifically for the data, has the potential to outperform current methods.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Global development goals increasingly rely on country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation's progress. To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional, national, and, for selected locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly available data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2017.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The causes of death database is composed of vital registration (VR), verbal autopsy (VA), registry, survey, police, and surveillance data. GBD 2017 added ten VA studies, 127 country-years of VR data, 502 cancer-registry country-years, and an additional surveillance country-year. Expansions of the GBD cause of death hierarchy resulted in 18 additional causes estimated for GBD 2017. Newly available data led to subnational estimates for five additional countries---Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia. Deaths assigned International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for non-specific, implausible, or intermediate causes of death were reassigned to underlying causes by redistribution algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty estimation. We used statistical modelling tools developed for GBD, including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to generate cause fractions and cause-specific death rates for each location, year, age, and sex. Instead of using UN estimates as in previous versions, GBD 2017 independently estimated population size and fertility rate for all locations. Years of life lost (YLLs) were then calculated as the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. All rates reported here are age-standardised.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}At the broadest grouping of causes of death (Level 1), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) comprised the greatest fraction of deaths, contributing to 73{$\cdot$}4\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 72{$\cdot$}5--74{$\cdot$}1) of total deaths in 2017, while communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) causes accounted for 18{$\cdot$}6\% (17{$\cdot$}9--19{$\cdot$}6), and injuries 8{$\cdot$}0\% (7{$\cdot$}7--8{$\cdot$}2). Total numbers of deaths from NCD causes increased from 2007 to 2017 by 22{$\cdot$}7\% (21{$\cdot$}5--23{$\cdot$}9), representing an additional 7{$\cdot$}61 million (7{$\cdot$}20--8{$\cdot$}01) deaths estimated in 2017 versus 2007. The death rate from NCDs decreased globally by 7{$\cdot$}9\% (7{$\cdot$}0--8{$\cdot$}8). The number of deaths for CMNN causes decreased by 22{$\cdot$}2\% (20{$\cdot$}0--24{$\cdot$}0) and the death rate by 31{$\cdot$}8\% (30{$\cdot$}1--33{$\cdot$}3). Total deaths from injuries increased by 2{$\cdot$}3\% (0{$\cdot$}5--4{$\cdot$}0) between 2007 and 2017, and the death rate from injuries decreased by 13{$\cdot$}7\% (12{$\cdot$}2--15{$\cdot$}1) to 57{$\cdot$}9 deaths (55{$\cdot$}9--59{$\cdot$}2) per 100 000 in 2017. Deaths from substance use disorders also increased, rising from 284 000 deaths (268 000--289 000) globally in 2007 to 352 000 (334 000--363 000) in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, total deaths from conflict and terrorism increased by 118{$\cdot$}0\% (88{$\cdot$}8--148{$\cdot$}6). A greater reduction in total deaths and death rates was observed for some CMNN causes among children younger than 5 years than for older adults, such as a 36{$\cdot$}4\% (32{$\cdot$}2--40{$\cdot$}6) reduction in deaths from lower respiratory infections for children younger than 5 years compared with a 33{$\cdot$}6\% (31{$\cdot$}2--36{$\cdot$}1) increase in adults older than 70 years. Globally, the number of deaths was greater for men than for women at most ages in 2017, except at ages older than 85 years. Trends in global YLLs reflect an epidemiological transition, with decreases in total YLLs from enteric infections, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, and maternal and neonatal disorders between 1990 and 2017; these were generally greater in magnitude at the lowest levels of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). At the same time, there were large increases in YLLs from neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases. YLL rates decreased across the five leading Level 2 causes in all SDI quintiles. The leading causes of YLLs in 1990---neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal diseases---were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in 2017. Meanwhile, estimated YLLs increased for ischaemic heart disease (ranked first in 2017) and stroke (ranked third), even though YLL rates decreased. Population growth contributed to increased total deaths across the 20 leading Level 2 causes of mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in the cause-specific mortality rate reduced the effect of population growth for all but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Improvements in global health have been unevenly distributed among populations. Deaths due to injuries, substance use disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and cardiovascular disease are expanding threats to global health. For causes of death such as lower respiratory and enteric infections, more rapid progress occurred for children than for the oldest adults, and there is continuing disparity in mortality rates by sex across age groups. Reductions in the death rate of some common diseases are themselves slowing or have ceased, primarily for NCDs, and the death rate for selected causes has increased in the past decade.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The development of new technology such as wearables that record high-quality single channel ECG, provides an opportunity for ECG screening in a larger population, especially for atrial fibrillation screening. The main goal of this study is to develop an automatic classification algorithm for normal sinus rhythm (NSR), atrial fibrillation (AF), other rhythms (O), and noise from a single channel short ECG segment (9-60 seconds). For this purpose, signal quality index (SQI) along with dense convolutional neural networks was used. Two convolutional neural network (CNN) models (main model that accepts 15 seconds ECG and secondary model that processes 9 seconds shorter ECG) were trained using the training data set. If the recording is determined to be of low quality by SQI, it is immediately classified as noisy. Otherwise, it is transformed to a time-frequency representation and classified with the CNN as NSR, AF, O, or noise. At the final step, a feature-based post-processing algorithm classifies the rhythm as either NSR or O in case the CNN model's discrimination between the two is indeterminate. The best result achieved at the official phase of the PhysioNet/CinC challenge on the blind test set was 0.80 (F1 for NSR, AF, and O were 0.90, 0.80, and 0.70, respectively).},

Methods and Results--- We performed a retrospective cohort study among initially healthy blood donors with an index T cruzi--seropositive donation and age-, sex-, and period-matched seronegatives in 1996 to 2002 in the Brazilian cities of S{\~a}o Paulo and Montes Claros. In 2008 to 2010, all subjects underwent medical history, physical examination, ECGs, and echocardiograms. ECG and echocardiogram results were classified by blinded core laboratories, and records with abnormal results were reviewed by a blinded panel of 3 cardiologists who adjudicated the outcome of Chagas cardiomyopathy. Associations with Chagas cardiomyopathy were tested with multivariate logistic regression. Mean follow-up time between index donation and outcome assessment was 10.5 years for the seropositives and 11.1 years for the seronegatives. Among 499 T cruzi seropositives, 120 (24\%) had definite Chagas cardiomyopathy, and among 488 T cruzi seronegatives, 24 (5\%) had cardiomyopathy, for an incidence difference of 1.85 per 100 person-years attributable to T cruzi infection. Of the 120 seropositives classified as having Chagas cardiomyopathy, only 31 (26\%) presented with ejection fraction {$<$}50\%, and only 11 (9\%) were classified as New York Heart Association class II or higher. Chagas cardiomyopathy was associated (P{$<$}0.01) with male sex, a history of abnormal ECG, and the presence of an S3 heart sound. Conclusions--- There is a substantial annual incidence of Chagas cardiomyopathy among initially asymptomatic T cruzi--seropositive blood donors, although disease was mild at diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Binary classifiers are routinely evaluated with performance measures such as sensitivity and specificity, and performance is frequently illustrated with Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) plots. Alternative measures such as positive predictive value (PPV) and the associated Precision/Recall (PRC) plots are used less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While ROC plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether ROC plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. PRC plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use ROC plots on imbalanced datasets.},

Typically, better pre-trained models yield better transfer results, suggesting that initial accuracy is a key aspect of transfer learning performance. In this work, we identify another such aspect: we find that adversarially robust models, while less accurate, often perform better than their standard-trained counterparts when used for transfer learning. Specifically, we focus on adversarially robust ImageNet classifiers, and show that they yield improved accuracy on a standard suite of downstream classification tasks. Further analysis uncovers more differences between robust and standard models in the context of transfer learning. Our results are consistent with (and in fact, add to) recent hypotheses stating that robustness leads to improved feature representations.

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance in complex machine learning tasks such as image classification or speech recognition. However, due to their multi-layer nonlinear structure, they are not transparent, i.e., it is hard to grasp what makes them arrive at a particular classification or recognition decision given a new unseen data sample. Recently, several approaches have been proposed enabling one to understand and interpret the reasoning embodied in a DNN for a single test image. These methods quantify the ''importance'' of individual pixels wrt the classification decision and allow a visualization in terms of a heatmap in pixel/input space. While the usefulness of heatmaps can be judged subjectively by a human, an objective quality measure is missing. In this paper we present a general methodology based on region perturbation for evaluating ordered collections of pixels such as heatmaps. We compare heatmaps computed by three different methods on the SUN397, ILSVRC2012 and MIT Places data sets. Our main result is that the recently proposed Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) algorithm qualitatively and quantitatively provides a better explanation of what made a DNN arrive at a particular classification decision than the sensitivity-based approach or the deconvolution method. We provide theoretical arguments to explain this result and discuss its practical implications. Finally, we investigate the use of heatmaps for unsupervised assessment of neural network performance.},

The use of ECG signals in screening for LV systolic dysfunction is limited by their availability to clinicians. We developed a novel deep learning--based approach that can use ECG images for the screening of LV systolic dysfunction. METHODS: Using 12-lead ECGs plotted in multiple different formats, and corresponding echocardiographic data recorded within 15 days from the Yale New Haven Hospital between 2015 and 2021, we developed a convolutional neural network algorithm to detect an LV ejection fraction {$<$}40\%. The model was validated within clinical settings at Yale New Haven Hospital and externally on ECG images from Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA; Lake Regional Hospital in Osage Beach, MO; Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital in Houston, TX; and Methodist Cardiology Clinic of San Antonio, TX. In addition, it was validated in the prospective Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping was used to localize class-discriminating signals in ECG images. RESULTS: Overall, 385\,601 ECGs with paired echocardiograms were used for model development. The model demonstrated high discrimination power across various ECG image formats and calibrations in internal validation (area under receiving operation characteristics [AUROCs], 0.91; area under precision-recall curve [AUPRC], 0.55); and external sets of ECG images from Cedars Sinai (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.53), outpatient Yale New Haven Hospital clinics (AUROC, 0.94 and AUPRC, 0.77), Lake Regional Hospital (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.88), Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital (AUROC, 0.91 and AUPRC 0.88), Methodist Cardiology Clinic (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.74), and Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health cohort (AUROC, 0.95 and AUPRC, 0.45). An ECG suggestive of LV systolic dysfunction portended a {$>$}27-fold higher odds of LV systolic dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiogram (odds ratio, 27.5 [95\% CI, 22.3--33.9] in the held-out set). Class-discriminative patterns localized to the anterior and anteroseptal leads (V2 to V3), corresponding to the left ventricle regardless of the ECG layout. A positive ECG screen in individuals with an LV ejection fraction {$\geq$}40\% at the time of initial assessment was associated with a 3.9-fold increased risk of developing incident LV systolic dysfunction in the future (hazard ratio, 3.9 [95\% CI, 3.3--4.7]; median follow-up, 3.2 years). CONCLUSIONS: We developed and externally validated a deep learning model that identifies LV systolic dysfunction from ECG images. This approach represents an automated and accessible screening strategy for LV systolic dysfunction, particularly in low-resource settings.},

In this work, these architectures are proposed as general purposes, multi-step predictors for nonlinear time series. We analyze artificial, noise-free data generated by chaotic oscillators and compare LSTM nets with the benchmarks set by feed-forward, one-step-recursive and multi-output predictors. We focus on two different training methods for LSTM nets. The traditional one makes use of the so-called teacher forcing, i.e. the ground truth data are used as input for each time step ahead, rather than the outputs predicted for the previous steps. Conversely, the second feeds the previous predictions back into the recurrent neurons, as it happens when the network is used in forecasting. LSTM predictors robustly show the strengths of the two benchmark competitors, i.e., the good short-term performance of one-step-recursive predictors and greatly improved mid-long-term predictions with respect to feed-forward, multi-output predictors. Training LSTM predictors without teacher forcing is recommended to improve accuracy and robustness, and ensures a more uniform distribution of the predictive power within the chaotic attractor. We also show that LSTM architectures maintain good performances when the number of time lags included in the input differs from the actual embedding dimension of the dataset, a feature that is very important when working on real data.},

Despite its pervasiveness, the exact reasons for BatchNorm's effectiveness are still poorly understood. The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the layers' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called "internal covariate shift". In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm. Instead, we uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother. This smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients, allowing for faster training.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, data archiving of resting 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is mainly achieved by storing a PDF report in the hospital electronic health record (EHR). When available, digital ECG source data (raw samples) are only retained within the ECG management system. OBJECTIVE: The widespread availability of the ECG source data would undoubtedly permit successive analysis and facilitate longitudinal studies, with both scientific and diagnostic benefits. METHODS \& RESULTS: PDF-ECG is a hybrid archival format which allows to store in the same file both the standard graphical report of an ECG together with its source ECG data (waveforms). Using PDF-ECG as a model to address the challenge of ECG data portability, long-term archiving and documentation, a real-world proof-of-concept test was conducted in a northern Italy hospital. A set of volunteers undertook a basic ECG using routine hospital equipment and the source data captured. Using dedicated web services, PDF-ECG documents were then generated and seamlessly uploaded in the hospital EHR, replacing the standard PDF reports automatically generated at the time of acquisition. Finally, the PDF-ECG files could be successfully retrieved and re-analyzed. CONCLUSION: Adding PDF-ECG to an existing EHR had a minimal impact on the hospital's workflow, while preserving the ECG digital data.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiograms (AI-ECG) can be used to predict risk of future disease and mortality but has not yet been adopted into clinical practice. Existing model predictions lack actionability at an individual patient level, explainability and biological plausibility. We sought to address these limitations of previous AI-ECG approaches by developing the AI-ECG risk estimator (AIRE) platform. Methods and Results The AIRE platform was developed in a secondary care dataset of 1,163,401 ECGs from 189,539 patients, using deep learning with a discrete-time survival model to create a subject-specific survival curve using a single ECG. Therefore, AIRE predicts not only risk of mortality, but time-to-mortality. AIRE was validated in five diverse, transnational cohorts from the USA, Brazil and the UK, including volunteers, primary care and secondary care subjects. AIRE accurately predicts risk of all-cause mortality (C-index 0.775 (0.773-0.776)), cardiovascular (CV) death 0.832 (0.831-0.834), non-CV death (0.749 (0.747-0.751)), future ventricular arrhythmia (0.760 (0.756-0.763)), future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0.696 (0.694-0.698)) and future heart failure (0.787 (0.785-0.889))). Through phenome- and genome-wide association studies, we identified candidate biological pathways for the prediction of increased risk, including changes in cardiac structure and function, and genes associated with cardiac structure, biological aging and metabolic syndrome. Conclusion AIRE is an actionable, explainable and biologically plausible AI-ECG risk estimation platform that has the potential for use worldwide across a wide range of clinical contexts for short- and long-term risk estimation. {$<$}img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Figure" src="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2024/01/15/2024.01.13.24301267/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="373"/{$>$}Download figureOpen in new tab},

  abstract = {Subtle, prognostically-meaningful ECG features may not be apparent to physicians. In the course of supervised machine learning (ML) training, many thousands of ECG features are identified. These are not limited to conventional ECG parameters and morphology.To investigate novel neural network (NN)-derived ECG features, that may have clinical, phenotypic and genotypic associations and prognostic significance.We extracted 5120 NN-derived ECG features from an AI-ECG model trained for six simple diagnoses and applied unsupervised machine learning to identify three phenogroups. The derivation set, the Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiography (CODE) cohort (n = 1,558,421), is a database of ECGs recorded in primary care in Brazil. There were four external validation cohorts. A cohort of British civil servants (WH II, n = 5,066). A longitudinal study of volunteers in the UK (UK Biobank, n = 42,386). A longitudinal cohort of Brazilian public servants (ELSA-Brasil, n = 13,739). Lastly, a cohort of patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (SaMi-Trop, n = 1,631) .In the derivation cohort (CODE), the three phenogroups had significantly different mortality profiles (Figure 1). After adjusting for known covariates, phenogroup B had a 1.2-fold increase in long-term mortality compared to phenogroup A (HR 1.20, 95\% CI 1.17-1.23, p \&lt; 0.0001). We externally validated our findings in four diverse cohorts. Phenogroup C was poorly represented in the volunteer cohorts and therefore was excluded from those analyses. We found phenogroup B had a significantly greater risk of mortality in all cohorts (Figure 1). We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in the UK Biobank. We found ECG phenogroup significantly associated with cardiac and non-cardiac phenotypes, including cardiac chamber volumes and cardiac output (Figure 2A). A single-trait genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted. The GWAS yielded four loci (Figure 2B). SCN10A, SCN5A and CAV1 have well described roles in cardiac conduction and arrhythmia. ARHGAP24 has been previously associated with ECG parameters, however, our analysis has identified for the first time ARHGAP24 as a gene associated with a prognostically significant phenogroup. Mendelian randomisation demonstrated the higher risk ECG phenogroup was causally associated with higher odds of atrioventricular (AV) block but lower odds of atrial fibrillation and ischaemic heart disease.NN-derived ECG features have important applications beyond the original model from which they are derived and may be transferable and applicable for risk prediction in a wide range of settings, in addition to mortality prediction. We have shown the significant potential of NN-derived ECG features, as a highly transferable and potentially universal risk marker, that may be applied to a wide range of clinical contexts.},

  abstract = {Despite the widespread practical success of deep learning methods, our theoretical understanding of the dynamics of learning in deep neural networks remains quite sparse. We attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of deep learning by systematically analyzing learning dynamics for the restricted case of deep linear neural networks. Despite the linearity of their input-output map, such networks have nonlinear gradient descent dynamics on weights that change with the addition of each new hidden layer. We show that deep linear networks exhibit nonlinear learning phenomena similar to those seen in simulations of nonlinear networks, including long plateaus followed by rapid transitions to lower error solutions, and faster convergence from greedy unsupervised pretraining initial conditions than from random initial conditions. We provide an analytical description of these phenomena by finding new exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of deep learning. Our theoretical analysis also reveals the surprising finding that as the depth of a network approaches infinity, learning speed can nevertheless remain finite: for a special class of initial conditions on the weights, very deep networks incur only a finite, depth independent, delay in learning speed relative to shallow networks. We show that, under certain conditions on the training data, unsupervised pretraining can find this special class of initial conditions, while scaled random Gaussian initializations cannot. We further exhibit a new class of random orthogonal initial conditions on weights that, like unsupervised pre-training, enjoys depth independent learning times. We further show that these initial conditions also lead to faithful propagation of gradients even in deep nonlinear networks, as long as they operate in a special regime known as the edge of chaos.},

  abstract = {In this work we study the robustness to adversarial attacks, of early-stopping strategies on gradient-descent (GD) methods for linear regression. More precisely, we show that early-stopped GD is optimally robust (up to an absolute constant) against Euclidean-norm adversarial attacks. However, we show that this strategy can be arbitrarily sub-optimal in the case of general Mahalanobis attacks. This observation is compatible with recent findings in the case of classification{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}cite\{Vardi2022GradientMP\} that show that GD provably converges to non-robust models. To alleviate this issue, we propose to apply instead a GD scheme on a transformation of the data adapted to the attack. This data transformation amounts to apply feature-depending learning rates and we show that this modified GD is able to handle any Mahalanobis attack, as well as more general attacks under some conditions. Unfortunately, choosing such adapted transformations can be hard for general attacks. To the rescue, we design a simple and tractable estimator whose adversarial risk is optimal up to within a multiplicative constant of 1.1124 in the population regime, and works for any norm.},

However, the differences between those models makes a comparison of the properties of different aggregation functions hard. Our aim is to gain insight into different functions by directly comparing them on a fixed architecture for several common object recognition tasks. Empirical results show that a maximum pooling operation significantly outperforms subsampling operations. Despite their shift-invariant properties, overlapping pooling windows are no significant improvement over non-overlapping pooling windows. By applying this knowledge, we achieve state-of-the-art error rates of 4.57\% on the NORB normalized-uniform dataset and 5.6\% on the NORB jittered-cluttered dataset.},

Unfortunately, inexperienced physicians ordering the ECG may fail to recognize interpretation mistakes and accept the automated diagnosis without criticism. Clinical mismanagement may result, with the risk of exposing patients to useless~investigations or potentially dangerous treatment. Consequently, CIE over-reading and confirmation by an experienced ECG reader are essential and are repeatedly recommended in published reports. Implementation of new ECG knowledge is also important.

Firstly, nonlinear system identification is introduced to a wide audience, guiding practicing engineers and newcomers in the field to a sound solution of their data driven modeling problems for nonlinear dynamic systems. In addition, the article also provides a broad perspective on the topic to researchers that are already familiar with the linear system identification theory, showing the similarities and differences between the linear and nonlinear problem. The reader will be referred to the existing literature for detailed mathematical explanations and formal proofs. Here the focus is on the basic philosophy, giving an intuitive understanding of the problems and the solutions, by making a guided tour along the wide range of user choices in nonlinear system identification. Guidelines will be given in addition to many examples, to reach that goal.},

  abstract = {Block-oriented nonlinear models are popular in nonlinear modeling because of their advantages to be quite simple to understand and easy to use. To increase the flexibility of single branch block-oriented models, such as Hammerstein, Wiener, and Wiener-Hammerstein models, parallel block-oriented models can be considered. This paper presents a method to identify parallel Wiener-Hammerstein systems starting from input-output data only. In the first step, the best linear approximation is estimated for different input excitation levels. In the second step, the dynamics are decomposed over a number of parallel orthogonal branches. Next, the dynamics of each branch are partitioned into a linear time invariant subsystem at the input and a linear time invariant subsystem at the output. This is repeated for each branch of the model. The static nonlinear part of the model is also estimated during this step. The consistency of the proposed initialization procedure is proven. The method is validated on real-world measurements using a custom built parallel Wiener-Hammerstein test system.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a benchmark for nonlinear system identification. A Wiener-Hammerstein system is selected as test object. In such a structure there is no direct access to the static nonlinearity starting from the measured input/output, because it is sandwiched between two unknown dynamic systems. The signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements is quite high, which puts the focus of the benchmark on the ability to identify the nonlinear behaviour, and not so much on the noise rejection properties. The benchmark is not intended as a competition, but as a tool to compare the possibilities of different methods to deal with this specific nonlinear structure.},

  abstract = {We propose a technique for producing "visual explanations" for decisions from a large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers, (2) CNNs used for structured outputs, (3) CNNs used in tasks with multimodal inputs or reinforcement learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into their failure modes, (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform previous methods on localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and VQA, we show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it with neuron names to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM helps users establish appropriate trust in predictions from models and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a 'stronger' nodel from a 'weaker' one even when both make identical predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam/, along with a demo at http://gradcam.cloudcv.org, and a video at youtu.be/COjUB9Izk6E.},

METHODS: We compared the ECG-C rhythm interpretation  to that of 2 expert overreaders in 2112 randomly selected standard 12-lead ECGs.  RESULTS: The ECG-C correctly interpreted the rhythm in 1858 and incorrectly identified the rhythm in 254 (overall accuracy, 88.0\%). Sinus rhythm was correctly interpreted in 95.0\% of the ECGs (1666/1753) with this rhythm, whereas  nonsinus rhythms were correctly interpreted with an accuracy of only 53.5\% (192/359) (P {$<$} .0001). The ECG-C interpreted sinus rhythm with a sensitivity of 95\% (confidence interval, 93.8-96.7), specificity of 66.3\%, and positive predictive value of 93.2\%. The ECG-C interpreted nonsinus rhythms with a sensitivity of 72\%, (confidence interval, 68.7-73.7), a specificity of 93\%, and a positive predictive value of 59.3\%. Of the 254 ECGs that had incorrect rhythm interpretation, additional major errors were noted in 137 (54\%). CONCLUSIONS: The},

In particular paroxysmal AF is a form of AF that occurs occasionally, and has a higher probability of being undetected. In this work, we present an attention based deep learning framework for detection of paroxysmal AF episodes from a sequence of windows. Time-frequency representation of 30 seconds recording windows, over a 10 minute data segment, are fed sequentially into a deep convolutional neural network for image-based feature extraction, which are then presented to a bidirectional recurrent neural network with an attention layer for AF detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for transient AF detection, we use a database of 24 hour Holter Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings acquired from 2850 patients at the University of Virginia heart station. The algorithm achieves an AUC of 0.94 on the testing set, which exceeds the performance of baseline models. We also demonstrate the cross-domain generalizablity of the approach by adapting the learned model parameters from one recording modality (ECG) to another (photoplethysmogram) with improved AF detection performance. The proposed high accuracy, low false alarm algorithm for detecting paroxysmal AF has potential applications in long-term monitoring using wearable sensors.},

  abstract = {Classic machine learning methods are built on the \$i.i.d.\$ assumption that training and testing data are independent and identically distributed. However, in real scenarios, the \$i.i.d.\$ assumption can hardly be satisfied, rendering the sharp drop of classic machine learning algorithms' performances under distributional shifts, which indicates the significance of investigating the Out-of-Distribution generalization problem. Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization problem addresses the challenging setting where the testing distribution is unknown and different from the training. This paper serves as the first effort to systematically and comprehensively discuss the OOD generalization problem, from the definition, methodology, evaluation to the implications and future directions. Firstly, we provide the formal definition of the OOD generalization problem. Secondly, existing methods are categorized into three parts based on their positions in the whole learning pipeline, namely unsupervised representation learning, supervised model learning and optimization, and typical methods for each category are discussed in detail. We then demonstrate the theoretical connections of different categories, and introduce the commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we summarize the whole literature and raise some future directions for OOD generalization problem. The summary of OOD generalization methods reviewed in this survey can be found at http://out-of-distribution-generalization.com.},

  abstract = {Precise near-ground trajectory control is difficult for multi-rotor drones, due to the complex aerodynamic effects caused by interactions between multi-rotor airflow and the environment. Conventional control methods often fail to properly account for these complex effects and fall short in accomplishing smooth landing. In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning-based robust nonlinear controller (Neural Lander) that improves control performance of a quadrotor during landing. Our approach combines a nominal dynamics model with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that learns high-order interactions. We apply spectral normalization (SN) to constrain the Lipschitz constant of the DNN. Leveraging this Lipschitz property, we design a nonlinear feedback linearization controller using the learned model and prove system stability with disturbance rejection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DNN-based nonlinear feedback controller with stability guarantees that can utilize arbitrarily large neural nets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed controller significantly outperforms a Baseline Nonlinear Tracking Controller in both landing and cross-table trajectory tracking cases. We also empirically show that the DNN generalizes well to unseen data outside the training domain.},

We consider two visualisation techniques, based on computing the gradient of the class score with respect to the input image. The first one generates an image, which maximises the class score [Erhan et al., 2009], thus visualising the notion of the class, captured by a ConvNet. The second technique computes a class saliency map, specific to a given image and class. We show that such maps can be employed for weakly supervised object segmentation using classification ConvNets. Finally, we establish the connection between the gradient-based ConvNet visualisation methods and deconvolutional networks [Zeiler et al., 2013].},

These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively.

  abstract = {Efficient utilization of limited bandwidth with high-data-rate transmission while serving a large number of users is a prime requirement for present and future wireless communication systems. To meet this rising demand, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and cooperative communication have emerged as promising solutions due to their robustness in severely degraded channel conditions, link reliability, and spectral efficiency. Both OFDM and cooperative systems have challenged RF front-end specifications such as bandwidth and power-efficiency requirements for end users as well as for the base station due to the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In present and future communication systems, the power amplifier (PA) is a key component at the transmitter. To obtain maximum power efficiency, the PA is operated near its saturation point, which leads to nonlinear distortion (NLD), which is further exaggerated due to the high PAPR of the input signal. This NLD is expected to increase in future fifth-generation (5G) communication networks, due to the use of large bandwidth at millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies.},

  abstract = {Background Cardiologs{\textregistered} has developed the first electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm that uses a deep neural network (DNN) for full 12-lead ECG analysis, including rhythm, QRS and ST-T-U waves. We compared the accuracy of the first version of Cardiologs{\textregistered} DNN algorithm to the Mortara/Veritas{\textregistered} conventional algorithm in emergency department (ED) ECGs. Methods Individual ECG diagnoses were prospectively mapped to one of 16 pre-specified groups of ECG diagnoses, which were further classified as ``major'' ECG abnormality or not. Automated interpretations were compared to blinded experts'. The primary outcome was the performance of the algorithms in finding at least one ``major'' abnormality. The secondary outcome was the proportion of all ECGs for which all groups were identified, with no false negative or false positive groups (``accurate ECG interpretation''). Additionally, we measured sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for any abnormal group. Results Cardiologs{\textregistered} vs. Veritas{\textregistered} accuracy for finding a major abnormality was 92.2\% vs. 87.2\% (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), with comparable sensitivity (88.7\% vs. 92.0\%, p\,=\,0.086), improved specificity (94.0\% vs. 84.7\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) and improved positive predictive value (PPV 88.2\% vs. 75.4\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Cardiologs{\textregistered} had accurate ECG interpretation for 72.0\% (95\% CI: 69.6--74.2) of ECGs vs. 59.8\% (57.3--62.3) for Veritas{\textregistered} (P\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Sensitivity for any abnormal group for Cardiologs{\textregistered} and Veritas{\textregistered}, respectively, was 69.6\% (95CI 66.7--72.3) vs. 68.3\% (95CI 65.3--71.1) (NS). Positive Predictive Value was 74.0\% (71.1--76.7) for Cardiologs{\textregistered} vs. 56.5\% (53.7--59.3) for Veritas{\textregistered} (P\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Conclusion Cardiologs' DNN was more accurate and specific in identifying ECGs with at least one major abnormal group. It had a significantly higher rate of accurate ECG interpretation, with similar sensitivity and higher PPV.},

This report proposes several efficient ways to set the hyper-parameters that significantly reduce training time and improves performance. Specifically, this report shows how to examine the training validation/test loss function for subtle clues of underfitting and overfitting and suggests guidelines for moving toward the optimal balance point. Then it discusses how to increase/decrease the learning rate/momentum to speed up training. Our experiments show that it is crucial to balance every manner of regularization for each dataset and architecture. Weight decay is used as a sample regularizer to show how its optimal value is tightly coupled with the learning rates and momentums.},

  abstract = {Interactive image processing techniques, along with a linear-programming-based inductive classifier, have been used to create a highly accurate system for diagnosis of breast tumors. A small fraction of a fine needle aspirate slide is selected and digitized. With an interactive interface, the user initializes active contour models, known as snakes, near the boundaries of a set of cell nuclei. The customized snakes are deformed to the exact shape of the nuclei. This allows for precise, automated analysis of nuclear size, shape and texture. Ten such features are computed for each nucleus, and the mean value, largest (or 'worst') value and standard error of each feature are found over the range of isolated cells. After 569 images were analyzed in this fashion, different combinations of features were tested to find those which best separate benign from malignant samples. Ten-fold cross-validation accuracy of 97\% was achieved using a single separating plane on three of the thirty features: mean texture, worst area and worst smoothness. This represents an improvement over the best diagnostic results in the medical literature. The system is currently in use at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals. The same feature set has also been utilized in the much more difficult task of predicting distant recurrence of malignancy in patients, resulting in an accuracy of 86\%.},

The progress in the field of automatic ECG interpretation has up to now been hampered by a lack of appropriate datasets for training as well as a lack of well-defined evaluation procedures to ensure comparability of different algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we put forward first benchmarking results for the recently published, freely accessible PTB-XL dataset, covering a variety of tasks from different ECG statement prediction tasks over age and gender prediction to signal quality assessment. We find that convolutional neural networks, in particular resnet- and inception-based architectures, show the strongest performance across all tasks outperforming feature-based algorithms by a large margin. These results are complemented by deeper insights into the classification algorithm in terms of hidden stratification, model uncertainty and an exploratory interpretability analysis. We also put forward benchmarking results for the ICBEB2018 challenge ECG dataset and discuss prospects of transfer learning using classifiers pretrained on PTB-XL. With this resource, we aim to establish the PTB-XL dataset as a resource for structured benchmarking of ECG analysis algorithms and encourage other researchers in the field to join these efforts.},

In this paper, we address the case when the target domain is unlabeled, requiring unsupervised adaptation. CORAL[1] is a ``frustratingly easy'' unsupervised domain adaptation method that aligns the second-order statistics of the source and target distributions with a linear transformation. Here, we extend CORAL to learn a nonlinear transformation that aligns correlations of layer activations in deep neural networks (Deep CORAL).

Adversarial training using empirical risk minimization is considered to be the state-of-the-art method for defense against adversarial attacks. Despite being successful in practice, several problems in understanding generalization performance of adversarial training remain open. In this paper, we derive precise theoretical predictions for the performance of adversarial training in binary classification. We consider the high-dimensional regime where the dimension of data grows with the size of the training data-set at a constant ratio. Our results provide exact asymptotics for standard and adversarial errors of the estimators obtained by adversarial training with \${\textbackslash}ell\_q\$-norm bounded perturbations (\$q {\textbackslash}ge 1\$) for both discriminative binary models and generative Gaussian mixture models. Furthermore, we use these sharp predictions to uncover several intriguing observations on the role of various parameters including the over-parameterization ratio, the data model, and the attack budget on the adversarial and standard errors.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4\% top-1 / 97.1\% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7\%), Flowers (98.8\%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

Parameterization networks are used to ensure the long term integrity of extrapolated dynamics, while careful tuning of model hyperparameters against validation errors controls overfitting. A parameterization network is demonstrated on the logistic map, where chaos and other nonlinear phenomena consistent with the underlying model can be extrapolated from non-chaotic training time series with good fidelity. The stated results are a lot less fantastical than they appear to be because the neural network is only extrapolating between quadratic return maps. Nonetheless, the results do suggest that successful extrapolation of qualitatively different behaviors requires learning to occur on a level of abstraction where the corresponding behaviors are more similar in nature.},

  abstract = {Pruning the parameters of deep neural networks has generated intense interest due to potential savings in time, memory and energy both during training and at test time. Recent works have identified, through an expensive sequence of training and pruning cycles, the existence of winning lottery tickets or sparse trainable subnetworks at initialization. This raises a foundational question: can we identify highly sparse trainable subnetworks at initialization, without ever training, or indeed without ever looking at the data? We provide an affirmative answer to this question through theory driven algorithm design. We first mathematically formulate and experimentally verify a conservation law that explains why existing gradient-based pruning algorithms at initialization suffer from layer-collapse, the premature pruning of an entire layer rendering a network untrainable. This theory also elucidates how layer-collapse can be entirely avoided, motivating a novel pruning algorithm Iterative Synaptic Flow Pruning (SynFlow). This algorithm can be interpreted as preserving the total flow of synaptic strengths through the network at initialization subject to a sparsity constraint. Notably, this algorithm makes no reference to the training data and consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art pruning algorithms at initialization over a range of models (VGG and ResNet), datasets (CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny ImageNet), and sparsity constraints (up to 99.9 percent). Thus our data-agnostic pruning algorithm challenges the existing paradigm that data must be used to quantify which synapses are important.},

  abstract = {WaveCycleGAN has recently been proposed to bridge the gap between natural and synthesized speech waveforms in statistical parametric speech synthesis and provides fast inference with a moving average model rather than an autoregressive model and high-quality speech synthesis with the adversarial training. However, the human ear can still distinguish the processed speech waveforms from natural ones. One possible cause of this distinguishability is the aliasing observed in the processed speech waveform via down/up-sampling modules. To solve the aliasing and provide higher quality speech synthesis, we propose WaveCycleGAN2, which 1) uses generators without down/up-sampling modules and 2) combines discriminators of the waveform domain and acoustic parameter domain. The results show that the proposed method 1) alleviates the aliasing well, 2) is useful for both speech waveforms generated by analysis-and-synthesis and statistical parametric speech synthesis, and 3) achieves a mean opinion score comparable to those of natural speech and speech synthesized by WaveNet (open WaveNet) and WaveGlow while processing speech samples at a rate of more than 150 kHz on an NVIDIA Tesla P100.},

  abstract = {The steam generator is one of the most essential equipment of the nuclear power device which takes part in heat exchanging. The water level system of a steam generator has the peculiarities of apparent nonlinearity, large inertia and time-delaying. Furthermore, the water level of a steam generator has a direct impact on the quality of the outlet steam and the security of the system. Thus, it is significant and necessary to maintain the water level within a safety limit. the mathematical model of the steam generator, which is difficult to be described with integer order, can be established relatively clearly and precisely by using the fractional order calculus. With the progress of the modern technology, the merits of using a fractional order model become increasingly obvious due to its good performance in describing the actual plants and the dynamic process. This paper proposes a fractional order system identification method which can identify the model parameters concisely. This method is simple to be realized and also has a good adaptability to the initial value. The proposed fractional order identification scheme provides a new method of the important equipment modeling in nuclear power plant. The model that established by this method can provide research basis and technical support of the high precision and performance index control system.},

These features include morphological and rhythm-related features that are used to build two classifiers: one that evaluates the record globally, using aggregated values for each feature; and another one that evaluates the record as a sequence, using a Recurrent Neural Network fed with the individual features for each detected heartbeat. The two classifiers are finally combined using the stacking technique, providing an answer by means of four target classes: Normal sinus rhythm (N), Atrial fibrillation (A), Other anomaly (O) and Noisy ({\textasciitilde}). The approach has been validated against the 2017 Physionet/CinC Challenge dataset, obtaining a final score of 0.83 and ranking first in the competition.},

We evaluated 12 approaches in high-dimensional Cox models in randomized clinical trials: penalization of the biomarker main effects and biomarker-by-treatment interactions (full-lasso, three kinds of adaptive lasso, ridge+lasso and group-lasso); dimensionality reduction of the main effect matrix via linear combinations (PCA+lasso (where PCA is principal components analysis) or PLS+lasso (where PLS is partial least squares)); penalization of modified covariates or of the arm-specific biomarker effects (two-I model); gradient boosting; and univariate approach with control of multiple testing. We compared these methods via simulations, evaluating their selection abilities in null and alternative scenarios. We varied the number of biomarkers, of nonnull main effects and true biomarker-by-treatment interactions. We also proposed a novel measure evaluating the interaction strength of the developed gene signatures. In the null scenarios, the group-lasso, two-I model, and gradient boosting performed poorly in the presence of nonnull main effects, and performed well in alternative scenarios with also high interaction strength. The adaptive lasso with grouped weights was too conservative. The modified covariates, PCA+lasso, PLS+lasso, and ridge+lasso performed moderately. The full-lasso and adaptive lassos performed well, with the exception of the full-lasso in the presence of only nonnull main effects. The univariate approach performed poorly in alternative scenarios. We also illustrate the methods using gene expression data from 614 breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.},

In addition to a nominal model, the set of all models consistent with data and prior information is derived as well, making the approach suitable for robust control design within a Model Predictive Control framework. The resulting parameter identification problem is solved through a sequence of convex programs. Convergence of the identified error bounds to their theoretical minimum is demonstrated, under suitable assumptions on the measured data, and features like worst-case accuracy computation are illustrated in a numerical example.},

This relationship reveals an important mathematical property of GEVD in which the second argument act as prior information in the model. Thus we show that MLGEVD allows the incorporation of external knowledge about the quantities of interest into the estimation problem. We illustrate the importance of prior knowledge in clinical decision making/identifying differentially expressed genes with case studies for which microarray data sets with corresponding clinical/literature information are available. On all of these three case studies, MLGEVD outperformed GEVD on prediction in terms of test area under the ROC curve (test AUC).

We focus on the problem of linear regression and consider a general class of optimization methods that minimize a loss function measuring the misfit of the model to the observations with an added structured-inducing regularization term. Celebrated instances include the LASSO, Group-LASSO, Least-Absolute Deviations method, etc.. We develop a quite general framework for how to determine precise prediction performance guaranties (e.g. mean-square-error) of such methods for the case of Gaussian measurement ensemble. The  machinery builds upon  Gordon's Gaussian min-max theorem under additional convexity assumptions that arise in many practical applications. This theorem associates with a primary optimization (PO) problem a simplified auxiliary optimization  (AO) problem from which we can tightly infer properties of the original (PO), such as the optimal cost, the norm of the optimal solution, etc. Our theory applies to general loss functions and regularization and provides guidelines on how to optimally tune the regularizer coefficient when certain structural properties (such as sparsity level, rank, etc.) are known.},

  abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI) is also called the heart attack, and it results in the death of heart muscle cells due to the lacking in the supply of oxygen and other nutrients. The early and accurate detection of MI using the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is helpful in the clinical standard for saving the lives of the patients suffering from this pathology. This paper proposes a novel approach for the detection of MI pathology using the multiresolution analysis of 12-lead ECG signals. The approach is based on the use of Fourier--Bessel series expansion-based empirical wavelet transform (FBSE-EWT) for the time-scale decomposition of 12-lead ECG signals. For each lead ECG signal, nine subband signals are evaluated using FBSE-EWT. The statistical features such as the kurtosis, the skewness, and the entropy are evaluated from the subband signals of each ECG lead. The deep neural network such as the deep layer least-square support-vector machine (DL-LSSVM) which is formulated using the hidden layers of sparse auto-encoders and the LSSVM is used for the detection of MI from the feature vector of 12-lead ECG. The experimental results demonstrate that the combination of FBSE-EWT-based entropy features and DL-LSSVM has the mean accuracy, the mean sensitivity, and the mean specificity values of 99.74\%, 99.87\%, and 99.60\%, respectively, for the detection of MI. The accuracy value of the proposed method is improved by more than 3\% as compared to the wavelet-based features for the detection of MI.},

Specifically, training robust models may not only be more resource-consuming, but also lead to a reduction of standard accuracy. We demonstrate that this trade-off between the standard accuracy of a model and its robustness to adversarial perturbations provably exists even in a fairly simple and natural setting. These findings also corroborate a similar phenomenon observed in practice. Further, we argue that this phenomenon is a consequence of robust classifiers learning fundamentally different feature representations than standard classifiers. These differences, in particular, seem to result in unexpected benefits: the features learned by robust models tend to align better with salient data characteristics and human perception.},

@phdthesis{umenberger_convex_2017,
  title = {Convex {{Identifcation}} of {{Stable Dynamical Systems}}},
  author = {Umenberger, Jack},
  year = {2017},
  address = {Sydney},
  abstract = {This thesis concerns the scalable application of convex optimization to data-driven mod- eling of dynamical systems, termed system identification in the control community. Two problems commonly arising in system identification are model instability (e.g. unreliability of long-term, open-loop predictions), and nonconvexity of quality-of-fit criteria, such as sim- ulation error (a.k.a. output error). To address these problems, this thesis presents convex parametrizations of stable dynamical systems, convex quality-of-fit criteria, and e cient algorithms to optimize the latter over the former. In particular, this thesis makes extensive use of Lagrangian relaxation, a technique for gen- erating convex approximations to nonconvex optimization problems. Recently, Lagrangian relaxation has been used to approximate simulation error and guarantee nonlinear model stability via semidefinite programming (SDP), however, the resulting SDPs have large di- mension, limiting their practical utility. The first contribution of this thesis is a custom interior point algorithm that exploits structure in the problem to significantly reduce com- putational complexity. The new algorithm enables empirical comparisons to established methods including Nonlinear ARX, in which superior generalization to new data is demon- strated. Equipped with this algorithmic machinery, the second contribution of this thesis is the in- corporation of model stability constraints into the maximum likelihood framework. Specifi- cally, Lagrangian relaxation is combined with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to derive tight bounds on the likelihood function, that can be optimized over a convex parametrization of all stable linear dynamical systems. Two di↵erent formulations are pre- sented, one of which gives higher fidelity bounds when disturbances (a.k.a. process noise) dominate measurement noise, and vice versa. Finally, identification of positive systems is considered. Such systems enjoy substantially simpler stability and performance analysis compared to the general linear time-invariant(LTI) case, and appear frequently in applications where physical constraints imply nonneg- ativity of the quantities of interest. Lagrangian relaxation is used to derive new convex parametrizations of stable positive systems and quality-of-fit criteria, and substantial im- provements in accuracy of the identified models, compared to existing approaches based on weighted equation error, are demonstrated. Furthermore, the convex parametrizations of stable systems based on linear Lyapunov functions are shown to be amenable to distributed optimization, which is useful for identification of large-scale networked dynamical systems.},

Besides providing a clear separation of prediction and decision making, the main advantage of probabilistic models is their ability to represent uncertainty about predictions. In safety-critical applications, it is pivotal for a model to possess an adequate sense of uncertainty, which for probabilistic classifiers translates into outputting probability distributions that are consistent with the empirical frequencies observed from realized outcomes. A classifier with such a property is called calibrated. In this work, we develop a general theoretical calibration evaluation framework grounded in probability theory, and point out subtleties present in model calibration evaluation that lead to refined interpretations of existing evaluation techniques. Lastly, we propose new ways to quantify and visualize miscalibration in probabilistic classification, including novel multidimensional reliability diagrams.},

This study aims to develop and validate a deep neural network for comprehensive automated ECG triage in daily practice. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a 37-\-layer convolutional residual deep neural network on a data set of free-\-text physician-a\-nnotated 12-l\-ead ECGs. The deep neural network was trained on a data set with 336.835 recordings from 142.040 patients and validated on an independent validation data set (n=984), annotated by a panel of 5 cardiologists electrophysiologists. The 12-\-lead ECGs were acquired in all noncardiology departments of the University Medical Center Utrecht. The algorithm learned to classify these ECGs into the following 4 triage categories: normal, abnormal not acute, subacute, and acute. Discriminative performance is presented with overall and category-s\- pecific concordance statistics, polytomous discrimination indexes, sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values. The patients in the validation data set had a mean age of 60.4 years and 54.3\% were men. The deep neural network showed excellent overall discrimination with an overall concordance statistic of 0.93 (95\% CI, 0.92--0.95) and a polytomous discriminatory index of 0.83 (95\% CI, 0.79--0.87). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that an end-\-to-\-end deep neural network can be accurately trained on unstructured free-t\-ext physician annotations and used to consistently triage 12-l\-ead ECGs. When further fine-\-tuned with other clinical outcomes and externally validated in clinical practice, the demonstrated deep learning--based ECG interpretation can potentially improve time to treatment and decrease healthcare burden.},

  abstract = {In this paper, two nonlinear optimization methods for the identification of nonlinear systems are compared. Both methods estimate the parameters of e.g. a polynomial nonlinear state-space model by means of a nonlinear least-squares optimization of the same cost function. While the first method does not estimate the states explicitly, the second method estimates both states and parameters adding an extra constraint equation. Both methods are introduced and their similarities and differences are discussed utilizing simulation data. The unconstrained method appears to be faster and more memory efficient, but the constrained method has a significant advantage as well: it is robust for unstable systems of which bounded input--output data can be measured (e.g. a system captured in a stabilizing feedback loop). Both methods have successfully been applied on real-life measurement data.},

In this paper, we derive two new N4SID algorithms to identify mixed deterministic-stochastic systems. Both algorithms determine state sequences through the projection of input and output data. These state sequences are shown to be outputs of non-steady state Kalman filter banks. From these it is easy to determine the state space system matrices. The N4SID algorithms are always convergent (non-iterative) and numerically stable since they only make use of QR and Singular Value Decompositions. Both N4SID algorithms are similar, but the second one trades off accuracy for simplicity. These new algorithms are compared with existing subspace algorithms in theory and in practice.},

  abstract = {Image pre-processing in the frequency domain has traditionally played a vital role in computer vision and was even part of the standard pipeline in the early days of deep learning. However, with the advent of large datasets, many practitioners concluded that this was unnecessary due to the belief that these priors can be learned from the data itself. Frequency aliasing is a phenomenon that may occur when sub-sampling any signal, such as an image or feature map, causing distortion in the sub-sampled output. We show that we can mitigate this effect by placing non-trainable blur filters and using smooth activation functions at key locations, particularly where networks lack the capacity to learn them. These simple architectural changes lead to substantial improvements in out-of-distribution generalization on both image classification under natural corruptions on ImageNet-C [10] and few-shot learning on Meta-Dataset [17], without introducing additional trainable parameters and using the default hyper-parameters of open source codebases.},

  abstract = {Decision tree classifiers perform a greedy search for rules by heuristically selecting the most promising features. Such greedy (local) search may discard important rules. Associative classifiers, on the other hand, perform a global search for rules satisfying some quality constraints (i.e., minimum support). This global search, however, may generate a large number of rules. Further, many of these rules may be useless during classification, and worst, important rules may never be mined. Lazy (non-eager) associative classification overcomes this problem by focusing on the features of the given test instance, increasing the chance of generating more rules that are useful for classifying the test instance. In this paper we assess the performance of lazy associative classification. First we demonstrate that an associative classifier performs no worse than the corresponding decision tree classifier. Also we demonstrate that lazy classifiers outperform the corresponding eager ones. Our claims are empirically confirmed by an extensive set of experimental results. We show that our proposed lazy associative classifier is responsible for an error rate reduction of approximately 10\% when compared against its eager counterpart, and for a reduction of 20\% when compared against a decision tree classifier. A simple caching mechanism makes lazy associative classification fast, and thus improvements in the execution time are also observed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is widely performed by emergency physicians. We aimed to determine the accuracy of interpretation of potential ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) ECGs by emergency physicians. METHODS: Thirty-six ECGs resulted in putative STEMI diagnoses were selected. Participants were asked to focus on whether or not the ECG in question met the diagnostic criteria for an acutely blocked coronary artery causing a STEMI. Based on the coronary angiogram, a binary outcome of accurate versus inaccurate ECG interpretation was defined. We computed the overall sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CIs) for ECG interpretation. Data on participant training level, working experience and place were collected. RESULTS: 135 participants interpreted 4603 ECGs. Overall sensitivity to identify 'true' STEMI ECGs was 64.5\% (95\%CI: 62.8-66.3); specificity in determining 'false' ECGs was 78\% (95\%CI: 76-80.1). Overall accuracy was modest (69.1, 95\%CI: 67.8-70.4). Higher accuracy in ECG interpretation was observed for attending physicians, participants working in tertiary care hospitals and those more experienced. CONCLUSION: The accuracy of interpretation of potential STEMI ECGs was modest among emergency physicians. The study supports the notion that ECG interpretation for establishing a STEMI diagnosis lacks the necessary sensitivity and specificity to be considered a reliable 'stand-alone' diagnostic test.},

We show that the Lorentz singular values are variationally defined and give rise to entanglement monotones, with as a special case the concurrence. Next a necessary and sufficient criterion is conjectured for a mixed state to be convertible into another specific one with a nonzero probability. Finally the formalism of the Lorentz singular-value decomposition is applied to tripartite pure states of qubits. New proofs are given for the existence of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) class and W class of states, and a rigorous proof for the optimal distillation of a GHZ state is derived.},

We demonstrate the forecasting performance of the LSTM and compare it with Gaussian processes (GPs) in time series obtained from the Lorenz 96 system, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation and a prototype climate model. The LSTM networks outperform the GPs in short-term forecasting accuracy in all applications considered.

The current measurement method based on blood tests is accurate but invasive and time-consuming and is often unavailable for example in remote locations or an ambulance setting. In this paper, we explore the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for regression tasks to accurately predict continuous electrolyte concentrations from electrocardiograms (ECGs), a quick and widely adopted tool. We analyze our DNN models on a novel dataset of over 290,000 ECGs across four major electrolytes and compare their performance with traditional machine learning models. For improved understanding, we also study the full spectrum from continuous predictions to a binary classification of extreme concentration levels. Finally, we investigate probabilistic regression approaches and explore uncertainty estimates for enhanced clinical usefulness. Our results show that DNNs outperform traditional models but model performance varies significantly across different electrolytes. While discretization leads to good classification performance, it does not address the original problem of continuous concentration level prediction. Probabilistic regression has practical potential, but our uncertainty estimates are not perfectly calibrated. Our study is therefore a first step towards developing an accurate and reliable ECG-based method for electrolyte concentration level prediction---a method with high potential impact within multiple clinical scenarios.},

  abstract = {Imbalances in electrolyte concentrations can have severe consequences, but accurate and accessible measurements could improve patient outcomes. The current measurement method based on blood tests is accurate but invasive and time-consuming and is often unavailable for example in remote locations or an ambulance setting. In this paper, we explore the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for regression tasks to accurately predict continuous electrolyte concentrations from electrocardiograms (ECGs), a quick and widely adopted tool. We analyze our DNN models on a novel dataset of over 290,000 ECGs across four major electrolytes and compare their performance with traditional machine learning models. For improved understanding, we also study the full spectrum from continuous predictions to a binary classification of extreme concentration levels. Finally, we investigate probabilistic regression approaches and explore uncertainty estimates for enhanced clinical usefulness. Our results show that DNNs outperform traditional models but model performance varies significantly across different electrolytes. While discretization leads to good classification performance, it does not address the original problem of continuous concentration level prediction. Probabilistic regression has practical potential, but our uncertainty estimates are not perfectly calibrated. Our study is therefore a first step towards developing an accurate and reliable ECG-based method for electrolyte concentration level prediction---a method with high potential impact within multiple clinical scenarios.},

  abstract = {It is well known that it is challenging to train deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks for tasks that exhibit long term dependencies. The vanishing or exploding gradient problem is a well known issue associated with these challenges. One approach to addressing vanishing and exploding gradients is to use either soft or hard constraints on weight matrices so as to encourage or enforce orthogonality. Orthogonal matrices preserve gradient norm during backpropagation and may therefore be a desirable property. This paper explores issues with optimization convergence, speed and gradient stability when encouraging or enforcing orthogonality. To perform this analysis, we propose a weight matrix factorization and parameterization strategy through which we can bound matrix norms and therein control the degree of expansivity induced during backpropagation. We find that hard constraints on orthogonality can negatively affect the speed of convergence and model performance.},

A more recent regularized approach, inspired by machine learning and Bayesian methods, has also gained attention. Methods based on this approach estimate the system impulse response with excellent small-sample properties. In several applications, however, it is desirable to obtain a compact representation of the system in the form of a parametric model. By viewing the identification of such models as a decision, we develop a decision-theoretic formulation of the parametric system identification problem that bridges the gap between the classical and regularized approaches above. Using the output-error model class as an illustration, we show that this decision-theoretic approach leads to a regularized method that is robust to small sample-sizes as well as overparameterization.},

Major obstacles for the development of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms are both the lack of public datasets and well-defined benchmarking procedures to allow comparison s of different algorithms. To address these issues, we put forward PTB-XL, the to-date largest freely accessible clinical 12-lead ECG-waveform dataset comprising 21837 records from 18885 patients of 10\,seconds length. The ECG-waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists as a multi-label dataset, where diagnostic labels were further aggregated into super and subclasses. The dataset covers a broad range of diagnostic classes including, in particular, a large fraction of healthy records. The combination with additional metadata on demographics, additional diagnostic statements, diagnosis likelihoods, manually annotated signal properties as well as suggested folds for splitting training and test sets turns the dataset into a rich resource for the development and the evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms.},

Comprehensive simulation studies and comparisons with standard SLFNs are carried out on real-world regression benchmark data sets. Simulation results demonstrate that the innovative GSLFNs using BR-ELM and OSR-ELM are superior to standard SLFNs in terms of accuracy, training speed, and structure compactness.},

Since norms of the output weight and training errors are minimized simultaneously, the HRLS achieves high accuracy in terms of both generalization and approximation. Simulation studies and comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that the HRLS is numerically more stable and superior to other algorithms in terms of accuracy and speed.},

The proposed ELMs are developed by innovative decomposition of the recursive orthogonal least squares procedure into sequential partial orthogonalization (SPO). The salient features of the proposed approaches are as follows: 1) Initial hidden nodes are randomly generated by the ELM methodology and recursively orthogonalized into an upper triangular matrix with dramatic reduction in matrix size; 2) the constructive SPO in the CP-ELM focuses on the partial matrix with the subcolumn of the selected regressor including nonzeros as the first column while the destructive SPO in the DP-ELM operates on the partial matrix including elements determined by the removed regressor; 3) termination criteria for CP- and DP-ELM are simplified by the additional residual error reduction method; and 4) the output weights of the SLFN need not be solved in the model selection procedure and is derived from the final upper triangular equation by backward substitution. Both single- and multi-output real-world regression data sets are used to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the CP- and DP-ELM in terms of parsimonious architecture and generalization accuracy.

We extend its application to the regression model with autoregressive errors. Two types of lasso estimators are carefully studied. The first is similar to the traditional lasso estimator with only two tuning parameters (one for regression coefficients and the other for autoregression coeffi). These tuning parameters can be easily calculated via a data-driven method, but the resulting lasso estimator may not be fully efficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose a second lasso estimator which uses different tuning parameters for each coefficient. We show that this modified lasso can produce the estimator as efficiently as the oracle. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for tuning parameter estimates to obtain the modified lasso estimator. Simulation studies demonstrate that the modified estimator is superior to the traditional estimator. One empirical example is also presented to illustrate the usefulness of lasso estimators. The extension of the lasso to the autoregression with exogenous variables model is briefly discussed.},

This task is known as hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC), with applications in text classification, image annotation, and in bioinformatics problems such as protein function prediction. In this paper, we propose novel neural network architectures for HMC called HMCN, capable of simultaneously optimizing local and global loss functions for discovering local hierarchical class-relationships and global information from the entire class hierarchy while penalizing hierarchical violations. We evaluate its performance in 21 datasets from four distinct domains, and we compare it against the current HMC state-of-the-art approaches. Results show that HMCN substantially outperforms all baselines with statistical significance, arising as the novel state-of-the-art for HMC.},

  abstract = {Despite extensive studies, the underlying reason as to why overparameterized neural networks can generalize remains elusive. Existing theory shows that common stochastic optimizers prefer flatter minimizers of the training loss, and thus a natural potential explanation is that flatness implies generalization. This work critically examines this explanation. Through theoretical and empirical investigation, we identify the following three scenarios for two-layer ReLU networks: (1) flatness provably implies generalization; (2) there exist non-generalizing flattest models and sharpness minimization algorithms fail to generalize poorly, and (3) perhaps most strikingly, there exist non-generalizing flattest models, but sharpness minimization algorithms still generalize. Our results suggest that the relationship between sharpness and generalization subtly depends on the data distributions and the model architectures and sharpness minimization algorithms do not only minimize sharpness to achieve better generalization. This calls for the search for other explanations for the generalization of over-parameterized neural networks},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computer programs for the interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) are now widely used. However, a systematic assessment of various computer programs for the interpretation of ECGs has not been performed. METHODS: We undertook a large international study to compare the performance of nine electrocardiographic computer programs with that of eight cardiologists in interpreting ECGs in 1220 clinically validated cases of various cardiac disorders. ECGs from the following groups were included in the sample: control patients (n = 382); patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 183), right ventricular hypertrophy (n = 55), or biventricular hypertrophy (n = 53); patients with anterior myocardial infarction (n = 170), inferior myocardial infarction (n = 273), or combined myocardial infarction (n = 73); and patients with combined infarction and hypertrophy (n = 31). The interpretations of the computer programs and the cardiologists were compared with the clinical diagnoses made independently of the ECGs, and the computer interpretations were compared with those of the cardiologists. RESULTS: The percentage of ECGs correctly classified by the computer programs (median, 91.3 percent) was lower than that of the cardiologists (median, 96.0 percent; P less than 0.01). The median sensitivity of the computer programs was also significantly lower than that of the cardiologists in diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy (56.6 percent vs. 63.9 percent, P less than 0.02), right ventricular hypertrophy (31.8 percent vs. 46.6 percent, P less than 0.01), anterior myocardial infarction (77.1 percent vs. 84.9 percent, P less than 0.001), and inferior myocardial infarction (58.8 percent vs. 71.7 percent, P less than 0.0001). The median total accuracy level (the percentage of correct classifications) was 6.6 percent lower for the computer programs (69.7 percent) than for the cardiologists (76.3 percent; P less than 0.001). However, the performance of the best programs nearly matched that of the most accurate cardiologists. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that some but not all computer programs for the interpretation of ECGs perform almost as well as cardiologists in identifying seven major cardiac disorders.},

The steadfast usage of this algorithm requires constant evaluation and upgrading of foundational concepts to maintain progress. Network regularization techniques typically focus on convolutional layer operations, while leaving pooling layer operations without suitable options. We introduce Wavelet Pooling as another alternative to traditional neighborhood pooling. This method decomposes features into a second level decomposition, and discards the first-level subbands to reduce feature dimensions. This method addresses the overfitting problem encountered by max pooling, while reducing features in a more structurally compact manner than pooling via neighborhood regions. Experimental results on four benchmark classification datasets demonstrate our proposed method outperforms or performs comparatively with methods like max, mean, mixed, and stochastic pooling.},

  abstract = {Soil carbon sequestration in agroecosystems could play a key role in climate change mitigation but will require accurate predictions of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks over spatial scales relevant to land management. Spatial variation in underlying drivers of SOC, such as plant productivity and soil mineralogy, complicates these predictions. Recent advances in the availability of remotely sensed data make it practical to generate multidecadal time series of vegetation indices with high spatial resolution and coverage. However, the utility of such data largely is unknown, only having been tested with shorter (e.g., 1--2~yr) data summaries. Across a 2,000~ha subtropical grassland, we found that a long time series (28~yr) of a vegetation index (Enhanced Vegetation Index; EVI) derived from the Landsat 5 satellite significantly enhanced prediction of spatially varying SOC pools, while a short summary (2~yr) was an ineffective predictor. EVI was the best predictor for surface SOC (0--5~cm depth) and total measured SOC stocks (0--15~cm). The optimum models for SOC in the upper soil layer combined EVI records with elevation and calcium concentration, while deeper SOC was more strongly associated with calcium availability. We demonstrate how data from the open access Landsat archive can predict SOC stocks, a key ecosystem metric, and illustrate the rich variety of analytical approaches that can be applied to long time series of remotely sensed greenness. Overall, our results showed that SOC pools were closely coupled to EVI in this ecosystem, demonstrating that maintenance of higher average green leaf area is correlated with higher SOC. The strong associations of vegetation greenness and calcium concentration with SOC suggest that the ability to sequester additional SOC likely will rely on strategic management of pasture vegetation and soil fertility.},

Because of the general assumptions, the data can come from DGMs different than standard time series models such as VAR or ARCH. When the true DGM is not VAR, the lasso estimates correspond to those of the best linear predictors using the past observations. We establish non-asymptotic inequalities for estimation and prediction errors of the lasso estimates. Together with{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}cite\{wong2017lasso\}, we provide lasso guarantees that cover full spectrum of the parameters in specifications of \$ {\textbackslash}beta \$-mixing subgaussian time series. Applications of these results potentially extend to non-Gaussian, non-Markovian and non-linear times series models as the examples we provide demonstrate.

In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by learning perturbation sets from data, in order to characterize real-world effects for robust training and evaluation. Specifically, we use a conditional generator that defines the perturbation set over a constrained region of the latent space. We formulate desirable properties that measure the quality of a learned perturbation set, and theoretically prove that a conditional variational autoencoder naturally satisfies these criteria. Using this framework, our approach can generate a variety of perturbations at different complexities and scales, ranging from baseline digit transformations, through common image corruptions, to lighting variations. We measure the quality of our learned perturbation sets both quantitatively and qualitatively, finding that our models are capable of producing a diverse set of meaningful perturbations beyond the limited data seen during training. Finally, we leverage our learned perturbation sets to learn models which have improved generalization performance and are empirically and certifiably robust to adversarial image corruptions and adversarial lighting variations.

  abstract = {Imposition of a lasso penalty shrinks parameter estimates toward zero and performs continuous model selection. Lasso penalized regression is capable of handling linear regression problems where the number of predictors far exceeds the number of cases. This paper tests two exceptionally fast algorithms for estimating regression coefficients with a lasso penalty. The previously known {$\ell_2$} algorithm is based on cyclic coordinate descent. Our new {$\ell_1$} algorithm is based on greedy coordinate descent and Edgeworth's algorithm for ordinary {$\ell_1$} regression. Each algorithm relies on a tuning constant that can be chosen by cross-validation. In some regression problems it is natural to group parameters and penalize parameters group by group rather than separately. If the group penalty is proportional to the Euclidean norm of the parameters of the group, then it is possible to majorize the norm and reduce parameter estimation to {$\ell_2$} regression with a lasso penalty. Thus, the existing algorithm can be extended to novel settings. Each of the algorithms discussed is tested via either simulated or real data or both. The Appendix proves that a greedy form of the {$\ell_2$} algorithm converges to the minimum value of the objective function.},

In this paper we present a new method to learn linear encoders that adapt to data, while still performing well with the widely used \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ decoder. The convex \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ decoder prevents gradient propagation as needed in standard gradient-based training. Our method is based on the insight that unrolling the convex decoder into \$T\$ projected subgradient steps can address this issue. Our method can be seen as a data-driven way to learn a compressed sensing measurement matrix. We compare the empirical performance of 10 algorithms over 6 sparse datasets (3 synthetic and 3 real). Our experiments show that there is indeed additional structure beyond sparsity in the real datasets; our method is able to discover it and exploit it to create excellent reconstructions with fewer measurements (by a factor of 1.1-3x) compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods. We illustrate an application of our method in learning label embeddings for extreme multi-label classification, and empirically show that our method is able to match or outperform the precision scores of SLEEC, which is one of the state-of-the-art embedding-based approaches.},

  abstract = {It is commonly believed that networks cannot be both accurate and robust, that gaining robustness means losing accuracy. It is also generally believed that, unless making networks larger, network architectural elements would otherwise matter little in improving adversarial robustness. Here we present evidence to challenge these common beliefs by a careful study about adversarial training. Our key observation is that the widely-used ReLU activation function significantly weakens adversarial training due to its non-smooth nature. Hence we propose smooth adversarial training (SAT), in which we replace ReLU with its smooth approximations to strengthen adversarial training. The purpose of smooth activation functions in SAT is to allow it to find harder adversarial examples and compute better gradient updates during adversarial training. Compared to standard adversarial training, SAT improves adversarial robustness for "free", i.e., no drop in accuracy and no increase in computational cost. For example, without introducing additional computations, SAT significantly enhances ResNet-50's robustness from 33.0\% to 42.3\%, while also improving accuracy by 0.9\% on ImageNet. SAT also works well with larger networks: it helps EfficientNet-L1 to achieve 82.2\% accuracy and 58.6\% robustness on ImageNet, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art defense by 9.5\% for accuracy and 11.6\% for robustness.},

Beyond the existing studies on the predictive performance to adversarial samples, our goal is to understand statistical properties of adversarial robust estimates and analyze adversarial risk in the setup of linear regression models. By discovering the statistical minimax rate of convergence of adversarial robust estimators, we emphasize the importance of incorporating model information, e.g., sparsity, in adversarial robust learning. Further, we reveal an explicit connection of adversarial and standard estimates, and propose a straightforward two-stage adversarial training framework, which facilitates to utilize model structure information to improve adversarial robustness. In theory, the consistency of the adversarial robust estimator is proven and its Bahadur representation is also developed for the statistical inference purpose. The proposed estimator converges in a sharp rate under either low-dimensional or sparse scenario. Moreover, our theory confirms two phenomena in adversarial robust learning: adversarial robustness hurts generalization, and unlabeled data help improve the generalization. In the end, we conduct numerical simulations to verify our theory.},

Theoretical studies of adversarial training algorithms mostly focus on their adversarial training losses or local convergence properties. In contrast, this paper studies the generalization performance of a generic adversarial training algorithm. Specifically, we consider linear regression models and two-layer neural networks (with lazy training) using squared loss under low-dimensional regime and high-dimensional regime. In the former regime, after overcoming the non-smoothness of adversarial training, the adversarial risk of the trained models will converge to the minimal adversarial risk. In the latter regime, we discover that data interpolation prevents the adversarial robust estimator from being consistent (i.e. converge in probability). Therefore, inspired by successes of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we incorporate the 1L1{\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}\_1 penalty in the high dimensional adversarial learning, and show that it leads to consistent adversarial robust estimation. A series of numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate that how the smoothness and 1L1{\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}\_1 penalization help to improve the adversarial robustness of DNN models.},

The filter is defined by an ensemble of controlled stochastic systems (the particles). Each particle evolves under feedback control based on its own state, and features of the empirical distribution of the ensemble. The feedback control law is obtained as the solution to an optimal control problem, in which the optimization criterion is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the actual posterior, and the common posterior of any particle. The following conclusions are obtained for diffusions with continuous observations: 1) The optimal control solution is exact: The two posteriors match exactly, provided they are initialized with identical priors. 2) The optimal filter admits an innovation error-based gain feedback structure. 3) The optimal feedback gain is obtained via a solution of an Euler-Lagrange boundary value problem; the feedback gain equals the Kalman gain in the linear Gaussian case. Numerical algorithms are introduced and implemented in two general examples, and a neuroscience application involving coupled oscillators. In some cases it is found that the filter exhibits significantly lower variance when compared to the bootstrap particle filter.},

This is known as the gradient independence assumption (GIA). We identify a commonly satisfied condition, which we call Simple GIA Check, such that the NTK limit calculation based on GIA is correct. Conversely, when Simple GIA Check fails, we show GIA can result in wrong answers.

This study expanded RFM model by including two parameters, time since first purchase and churn probability. Using Bernoulli sequence in probability theory, we derive out the formula that can estimate the probability that one customer will buy at the next time, and the expected value of the total number of times that the customer will buy in the future. This study also proposed the methodology to estimate the unknown parameters in the formula. This methodology leads to more efficient and accurate selection procedures than the existing ones. In the empirical part we examine a case study, blood transfusion service, to show that our methodology has greater predictive accuracy than traditional RFM approaches.},

  abstract = {An echo state network (ESN) consists of a large, randomly connected neural network, the reservoir, which is driven by an input signal and projects to output units. During training, only the connections from the reservoir to these output units are learned. A key requisite for output-only training is the echo state property (ESP), which means that the effect of initial conditions should vanish as time passes. In this paper, we use analytical examples to show that a widely used criterion for the ESP, the spectral radius of the weight matrix being smaller than unity, is not sufficient to satisfy the echo state property. We obtain these examples by investigating local bifurcation properties of the standard ESNs. Moreover, we provide new sufficient conditions for the echo state property of standard sigmoid and leaky integrator ESNs. We furthermore suggest an improved technical definition of the echo state property, and discuss what practicians should (and should not) observe when they optimize their reservoirs for specific tasks.},

  abstract = {Achieving robustness to distributional shift is a longstanding and challenging goal of computer vision. Data augmentation is a commonly used approach for improving robustness, however robustness gains are typically not uniform across corruption types. Indeed increasing performance in the presence of random noise is often met with reduced performance on other corruptions such as contrast change. Understanding when and why these sorts of trade-offs occur is a crucial step towards mitigating them. Towards this end, we investigate recently observed trade-offs caused by Gaussian data augmentation and adversarial training. We find that both methods improve robustness to corruptions that are concentrated in the high frequency domain while reducing robustness to corruptions that are concentrated in the low frequency domain. This suggests that one way to mitigate these trade-offs via data augmentation is to use a more diverse set of augmentations. Towards this end we observe that AutoAugment, a recently proposed data augmentation policy optimized for clean accuracy, achieves state-of-the-art robustness on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark.},

In this paper, we focus on {$\ell\infty\ell\infty\backslash$}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty attacks, and study the adversarially robust generalization problem through the lens of Rademacher complexity. For binary linear classifiers, we prove tight bounds for the adversarial Rademacher complexity, and show that the adversarial Rademacher complexity is never smaller than its natural counterpart, and it has an unavoidable dimension dependence, unless the weight vector has bounded {$\ell$}1{$\ell$}1{\textbackslash}ell\_1 norm, and our results also extend to multi-class linear classifiers; in addition, for (nonlinear) neural networks, we show that the dimension dependence in the adversarial Rademacher complexity also exists. We further consider a surrogate adversarial loss for one-hidden layer ReLU network and prove margin bounds for this setting. Our results indicate that having {$\ell$}1{$\ell$}1{\textbackslash}ell\_1 norm constraints on the weight matrices might be a potential way to improve generalization in the adversarial setting. We demonstrate experimental results that validate our theoretical findings.},

Numerous studies have been conducted for penalized regression, but most of them are limited to the case when the data are independently observed. In this paper, we study a variable selection problem in penalized regression models with autoregressive (AR) error terms. We consider three estimators, adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, bridge, and smoothly clipped absolute deviation, and propose a computational algorithm that enables us to select a relevant set of variables and also the order of AR error terms simultaneously. In addition, we provide their asymptotic properties such as consistency, selection consistency, and asymptotic normality. The performances of the three estimators are compared with one another using simulated and real examples.},

  abstract = {(Frankle \& Carbin, 2019) shows that there exist winning tickets (small but critical subnetworks) for dense, randomly initialized networks, that can be trained alone to achieve comparable accuracies to the latter in a similar number of iterations. However, the identification of these winning tickets still requires the costly train-prune-retrain process, limiting their practical benefits. In this paper, we discover for the first time that the winning tickets can be identified at the very early training stage, which we term as early-bird (EB) tickets, via low-cost training schemes (e.g., early stopping and low-precision training) at large learning rates. Our finding of EB tickets is consistent with recently reported observations that the key connectivity patterns of neural networks emerge early. Furthermore, we propose a mask distance metric that can be used to identify EB tickets with low computational overhead, without needing to know the true winning tickets that emerge after the full training. Finally, we leverage the existence of EB tickets and the proposed mask distance to develop efficient training methods, which are achieved by first identifying EB tickets via low-cost schemes, and then continuing to train merely the EB tickets towards the target accuracy. Experiments based on various deep networks and datasets validate: 1) the existence of EB tickets, and the effectiveness of mask distance in efficiently identifying them; and 2) that the proposed efficient training via EB tickets can achieve up to 4.7x energy savings while maintaining comparable or even better accuracy, demonstrating a promising and easily adopted method for tackling cost-prohibitive deep network training.

The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems.

  abstract = {Background There is interest in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze medical imaging to provide computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Recent work has suggested that image classification CNNs may not generalize to new data as well as previously believed. We assessed how well CNNs generalized across three hospital systems for a simulated pneumonia screening task. Methods and findings A cross-sectional design with multiple model training cohorts was used to evaluate model generalizability to external sites using split-sample validation. A total of 158,323 chest radiographs were drawn from three institutions: National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIH; 112,120 from 30,805 patients), Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH; 42,396 from 12,904 patients), and Indiana University Network for Patient Care (IU; 3,807 from 3,683 patients). These patient populations had an age mean (SD) of 46.9 years (16.6), 63.2 years (16.5), and 49.6 years (17) with a female percentage of 43.5\%, 44.8\%, and 57.3\%, respectively. We assessed individual models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for radiographic findings consistent with pneumonia and compared performance on different test sets with DeLong's test. The prevalence of pneumonia was high enough at MSH (34.2\%) relative to NIH and IU (1.2\% and 1.0\%) that merely sorting by hospital system achieved an AUC of 0.861 (95\% CI 0.855--0.866) on the joint MSH--NIH dataset. Models trained on data from either NIH or MSH had equivalent performance on IU (P values 0.580 and 0.273, respectively) and inferior performance on data from each other relative to an internal test set (i.e., new data from within the hospital system used for training data; P values both {$<$}0.001). The highest internal performance was achieved by combining training and test data from MSH and NIH (AUC 0.931, 95\% CI 0.927--0.936), but this model demonstrated significantly lower external performance at IU (AUC 0.815, 95\% CI 0.745--0.885, P = 0.001). To test the effect of pooling data from sites with disparate pneumonia prevalence, we used stratified subsampling to generate MSH--NIH cohorts that only differed in disease prevalence between training data sites. When both training data sites had the same pneumonia prevalence, the model performed consistently on external IU data (P = 0.88). When a 10-fold difference in pneumonia rate was introduced between sites, internal test performance improved compared to the balanced model (10{\texttimes} MSH risk P {$<$} 0.001; 10{\texttimes} NIH P = 0.002), but this outperformance failed to generalize to IU (MSH 10{\texttimes} P {$<$} 0.001; NIH 10{\texttimes} P = 0.027). CNNs were able to directly detect hospital system of a radiograph for 99.95\% NIH (22,050/22,062) and 99.98\% MSH (8,386/8,388) radiographs. The primary limitation of our approach and the available public data is that we cannot fully assess what other factors might be contributing to hospital system--specific biases. Conclusion Pneumonia-screening CNNs achieved better internal than external performance in 3 out of 5 natural comparisons. When models were trained on pooled data from sites with different pneumonia prevalence, they performed better on new pooled data from these sites but not on external data. CNNs robustly identified hospital system and department within a hospital, which can have large differences in disease burden and may confound predictions.},

  abstract = {Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark Krizhevsky et al. [18]. However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.},

We further develop data augmentation and test-time fine-tuning methods to improve deep CAMA's robustness. When compared with discriminative deep neural networks, our proposed model shows superior robustness against unseen manipulations. As a by-product, our model achieves disentangled representation which separates the representation of manipulations from those of other latent causes.},

This is achieved by introducing a replacement scheme using an additional backward LAR stage. The backward stage replaces insignificant model terms selected by forward LAR with more significant ones, leading to an improved model in terms of the model compactness and performance. A numerical example to construct four types of NARX models, namely polynomials, radial basis function (RBF) networks, neuro fuzzy and wavelet networks, is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in comparison with some popular methods.},

Yet, their superior performance comes with the expensive cost of requiring correctly annotated large-scale datasets. Moreover, due to DNNs' rich capacity, errors in training labels can hamper performance. To combat this problem, mean absolute error (MAE) has recently been proposed as a noise-robust alternative to the commonly-used categorical cross entropy (CCE) loss. However, as we show in this paper, MAE can perform poorly with DNNs and challenging datasets. Here, we present a theoretically grounded set of noise-robust loss functions that can be seen as a generalization of MAE and CCE. Proposed loss functions can be readily applied with any existing DNN architecture and algorithm, while yielding good performance in a wide range of noisy label scenarios. We report results from experiments conducted with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and FASHION-MNIST datasets and synthetically generated noisy labels.},

Commonly used downsampling methods, such as max-pooling, strided-convolution, and average-pooling, ignore the sampling theorem. The well-known signal processing fix is anti-aliasing by low-pass filtering before downsampling. However, simply inserting this module into deep networks degrades performance; as a result, it is seldomly used today. We show that when integrated correctly, it is compatible with existing architectural components, such as max-pooling and strided-convolution. We observe {\textbackslash}textit\{increased accuracy\} in ImageNet classification, across several commonly-used architectures, such as ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet, indicating effective regularization. Furthermore, we observe {\textbackslash}textit\{better generalization\}, in terms of stability and robustness to input corruptions.

  abstract = {Vanishing and exploding gradients are two of the main obstacles in training deep neural networks, especially in capturing long range dependencies in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this paper, we present an efficient parametrization of the transition matrix of an RNN that allows us to stabilize the gradients that arise in its training. Specifically, we parameterize the transition matrix by its singular value decomposition (SVD), which allows us to explicitly track and control its singular values. We attain efficiency by using tools that are common in numerical linear algebra, namely Householder reflectors for representing the orthogonal matrices that arise in the SVD. By explicitly controlling the singular values, our proposed Spectral-RNN method allows us to provably solve the exploding gradient problem and we observe that it empirically solves the vanishing gradient issue to a large extent. We note that the SVD parameterization can be used for any rectangular weight matrix, hence it can be easily extended to any deep neural network, such as a multi-layer perceptron. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our parameterization does not lose any expressive power, and show how it controls generalization of RNN for the classification task. Our extensive experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed framework converges faster, and has good generalization, especially in capturing long range dependencies, as shown on the synthetic addition and copy tasks, as well as on the MNIST and Penn Tree Bank data sets.},

Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.},

  abstract = {Background:Automated cardiac image interpretation has the potential to transform clinical practice in multiple ways, including enabling serial assessment of cardiac function by nonexperts in primary care and rural settings. We hypothesized that advances in computer vision could enable building a fully automated, scalable analysis pipeline for echocardiogram interpretation, including (1) view identification, (2) image segmentation, (3) quantification of structure and function, and (4) disease detection.Methods:Using 14\,035 echocardiograms spanning a 10-year period, we trained and evaluated convolutional neural network models for multiple tasks, including automated identification of 23 viewpoints and segmentation of cardiac chambers across 5 common views. The segmentation output was used to quantify chamber volumes and left ventricular mass, determine ejection fraction, and facilitate automated determination of longitudinal strain through speckle tracking. Results were evaluated through comparison to manual segmentation and measurements from 8666 echocardiograms obtained during the routine clinical workflow. Finally, we developed models to detect 3 diseases: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Results:Convolutional neural networks accurately identified views (eg, 96\% for parasternal long axis), including flagging partially obscured cardiac chambers, and enabled the segmentation of individual cardiac chambers. The resulting cardiac structure measurements agreed with study report values (eg, median absolute deviations of 15\% to 17\% of observed values for left ventricular mass, left ventricular diastolic volume, and left atrial volume). In terms of function, we computed automated ejection fraction and longitudinal strain measurements (within 2 cohorts), which agreed with commercial software-derived values (for ejection fraction, median absolute deviation=9.7\% of observed, N=6407 studies; for strain, median absolute deviation=7.5\%, n=419, and 9.0\%, n=110) and demonstrated applicability to serial monitoring of patients with breast cancer for trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Overall, we found automated measurements to be comparable or superior to manual measurements across 11 internal consistency metrics (eg, the correlation of left atrial and ventricular volumes). Finally, we trained convolutional neural networks to detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension with C statistics of 0.93, 0.87, and 0.85, respectively.Conclusions:Our pipeline lays the groundwork for using automated interpretation to support serial patient tracking and scalable analysis of millions of echocardiograms archived within healthcare systems.},

  abstract = {The prediction of combined sewer overflow (CSO) operation in urban environments presents a challenging task for water utilities. The operation of CSOs (most often in heavy rainfall conditions) prevents houses and businesses from flooding. However, sometimes, CSOs do not operate as they should, potentially bringing environmental pollution risks. Therefore, CSOs should be appropriately managed by water utilities, highlighting the need for adapted decision support systems. This paper proposes an automated CSO predictive model construction methodology using field monitoring data, as a substitute for the commonly established hydrological-hydraulic modeling approach for time-series prediction of CSO statuses. It is a systematic methodology factoring in all monitored field variables to construct time-series dependencies for CSO statuses. The model construction process is largely automated with little human intervention, and the pertinent variables together with their associated time lags for every CSO are holistically and automatically generated. A fast least absolute shrinkage and selection operator solution generating scheme is proposed to expedite the model construction process, where matrix inversions are effectively eliminated. The whole algorithm works in a stepwise manner, invoking either an incremental or decremental movement for including or excluding one model regressor into, or from, the predictive model at every step. The computational complexity is thereby analyzed with the pseudo code provided. Actual experimental results from both single-step ahead (i.e., 15 min) and multistep ahead predictions are finally produced and analyzed on a U.K. pilot area with various types of monitoring data made available, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The performance of these networks often exceeds the performance of the non-sparse base model, but for reasons that were not well understood. In this paper we study the three critical components of the Lottery Ticket (LT) algorithm, showing that each may be varied significantly without impacting the overall results. Ablating these factors leads to new insights for why LT networks perform as well as they do. We show why setting weights to zero is important, how signs are all you need to make the reinitialized network train, and why masking behaves like training. Finally, we discover the existence of Supermasks, masks that can be applied to an untrained, randomly initialized network to produce a model with performance far better than chance (86\% on MNIST, 41\% on CIFAR-10).},

We show that uniformly bounding the difference between empirical and population errors cannot show any learning in the norm ball, and cannot show consistency for any set, even one depending on the exact algorithm and distribution. But we argue we can explain the consistency of the minimal-norm interpolator with a slightly weaker, yet standard, notion: uniform convergence of zero-error predictors in a norm ball.

  abstract = {Developing neural network image classification models often requires significant architecture engineering. In this paper, we study a method to learn the model architectures directly on the dataset of interest. As this approach is expensive when the dataset is large, we propose to search for an architectural building block on a small dataset and then transfer the block to a larger dataset. The key contribution of this work is the design of a new search space (the "NASNet search space") which enables transferability. In our experiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or "cell") on the CIFAR-10 dataset and then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking together more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters to design a convolutional architecture, named "NASNet architecture". We also introduce a new regularization technique called ScheduledDropPath that significantly improves generalization in the NASNet models. On CIFAR-10 itself, NASNet achieves 2.4\% error rate, which is state-of-the-art. On ImageNet, NASNet achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7\% top-1 and 96.2\% top-5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1.2\% better in top-1 accuracy than the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS - a reduction of 28\% in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of NASNets exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For instance, a small version of NASNet also achieves 74\% top-1 accuracy, which is 3.1\% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile platforms. Finally, the learned features by NASNet used with the Faster-RCNN framework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0\% achieving 43.1\% mAP on the COCO dataset.},

  abstract = {We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p {$\gg$} n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of training deep neural networks with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function using gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. In particular, we study the binary classification problem and show that for a broad family of loss functions, with proper random weight initialization, both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent can find the global minima of the training loss for an over-parameterized deep ReLU network, under mild assumption on the training data. The key idea of our proof is that Gaussian random initialization followed by (stochastic) gradient descent produces a sequence of iterates that stay inside a small perturbation region centering around the initial weights, in which the empirical loss function of deep ReLU networks enjoys nice local curvature properties that ensure the global convergence of (stochastic) gradient descent. Our theoretical results shed light on understanding the optimization for deep learning, and pave the way for studying the optimization dynamics of training modern deep neural networks.},

  abstract = {Objective: Over the past few years, deep learning (DL) has been used extensively in research for 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, it is unclear whether the explicit or implicit claims made on DL superiority to the more classical feature engineering (FE) approaches, based on domain knowledge, hold. In addition, it remains unclear whether combining DL with FE may improve performance over a single modality. Methods: To address these research gaps and in-line with recent major experiments, we revisited three tasks: cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis (multiclass-multilabel classification), atrial fibrillation risk prediction (binary classification), and age estimation (regression). We used an overall dataset of 2.3M 12-lead ECG recordings to train the following models for each task: i) a random forest taking FE as input; ii) an end-to-end DL model; and iii) a merged model of FE+DL. Results: FE yielded comparable results to DL while necessitating significantly less data for the two classification tasks. DL outperformed FE for the regression task. For all tasks, merging FE with DL did not improve performance over DL alone. These findings were confirmed on the additional PTB-XL dataset. Conclusion: We found that for traditional 12-lead ECG based diagnosis tasks, DL did not yield a meaningful improvement over FE, while it improved significantly the nontraditional regression task. We also found that combining FE with DL did not improve over DL alone, which suggests that the FE were redundant with the features learned by DL. Significance: Our findings provides important recommendations on 12-lead ECG based machine learning strategy and data regime to choose for a given task. When looking at maximizing performance as the end goal, if the task is nontraditional and a large dataset is available then DL is preferable. If the task is a classical one and/or a small dataset is available then a FE approach may be the better choice.},
